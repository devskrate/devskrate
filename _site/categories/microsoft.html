    "body": "2020/05/26 - Here is an easier and more seamless way to work with GitHub from the command line — GitHub CLI, currently it is in beta. Millions of developers rely on GitHub for software development to make it more fun and collaborative. The tool gh brings the GitHub experience right to your terminal. Installation: You can install GitHub CLI today on most of the Operating Systems available -  macOS Windows LinuxInstall this from here It’s available today for GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud, but not yet available for GitHub Enterprise Server. This will have support support for Enterprise Server when it’s out of beta. How to use?: gh currently suppports with issues and pull requests because many developers use them every day. Here are few examples provided by GitHub on how gh can improve your experience when contributing to an open source project.    Filter lists to your needs  Find an open source project you want to contribute to and clone the repository. And then, to see where maintainers want community contributions, use gh to filter the issues to only show those with help-wanted labels.        Quickly view the details  Find an issue describing a bug that seems like something you can fix, and use gh to quickly open it in the browser to get all the details you need to get started.        Create a pull request  Create a branch, make several commits to fix the bug described in the issue, and use gh to create a pull request to share your contribution. By using GitHub CLI to create pull requests, it also automatically creates a fork when you don’t already have one, and it pushes your branch and creates your pull request to get your change merged       View the status of your work  Get a quick snapshot the next morning of what happened since you created your pull request. gh shows the review and check status of your pull requests       Easily check out pull requests  One of the maintainers reviewed your pull request and requested changes. You probably switched branches since then, so use gh to checkout the pull request branch. We never remember the right commands either! Make the changes, push them, and soon enough the pull request is merged—congratulations!    How to contribute to GitHub CLI: GitHub CLI is an open-source project by GitHub.

    "title": "What is Deno.js? How this competes with node.js?",
    "body": "2020/05/24 - Deno is the creation of Ryan Dahl, which is a new JavaScript runtime for the backend, but instead of being written in C++, it’s written in Rust, based on the Tokio platform (which provides the asynchronous runtime needed by JavaScript), running on Google’s V8 engine. It is also a new runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser. Why should we use this?: Generally we may get a doubt, why should I use it, here are some of it’s features. They are: 1. Security is integratedNode. js allows you to access read and write into the filesystem, access environment variables, make outgoing requests, etc. As well as it also opens up a security risk if you are not careful when writing code. So instead, Deno uses command-line arguments to enable or disable access to different security features. So if you need your script to be able to access the /etc folder, you can do: deno --allow-read=/etc myscript. tsIt will allow your code to read from the folder, anything else and you’ll get a security exception. This is similar to how other platforms handle security. 2. Complete standard libraryDeno claims to have a complete standard library allowing developers to use official tools to perform basic tasks and only requiring the use of external libraries for complex tasks and it comes with the tools to add color to terminal text, generate UUIDs, work with external data structures, and for writing WebSockets. 3. Integrated TypescriptIn Deno, by default the integration into JavaScript is done internally, so no need for external tooling. By default Deno takes care of a lot, you can overwrite the configuration by using your own tsconfig. json file: deno run -c tsconfig. json [your-script. ts]The default configuration of Deno is to use strict mode, so any ill-advised coding practice will be alerted immediately. Deno Installation: Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below: Using Shell (macOS, Linux):$ curl -fsSL https://deno. land/x/install/install. sh | shUsing PowerShell (Windows):$ iwr https://deno. land/x/install/install. ps1 -useb | iexUsing Cargo (Windows, macOS, Linux):$ cargo install denoUsing Homebrew (macOS):$ brew install denoUsing Chocolatey (Windows):$ choco install denoUsing Scoop (Windows):$ scoop install denoWhere to learn Deno?: https://www. freecodecamp. org/news/the-deno-handbook/ About author:: Akash rao Mallareddy - Web Developer, StartUp Enthusiastic, Leader      Follow him on Linkedin, Github, Twitter "

    "title": "Microsoft Teams vs Slack:The Battle of collaborative work",
    "body": "2020/05/23 - Both Microsoft Teams and Slack are collaboration platform tools that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration. Back then, Slack began as an internal tool for Stewart Butterfield’s company Tiny Speck during the development of Glitch, an online game. Then Slack was launched in August 2013.  In 2016, Satya Nadella and Bill Gates met up to discuss an important matter. They wanted to bid 8 billion USD to acquire Slack, the SaaS giant that dominated the team chat app space. The meeting had a surprising conclusion: instead of buying Slack, they decided to build their own team chat app tool. In November 2016, Microsoft Teams was officially launched.  And now, both Teams and Slack had gained a good amount of daily active users. Choosing between Slack and Microsoft Teams for your next collaboration tool? Here’s what you need to know about the differences between the two, so you can choose the platform that best suits the needs of your team. : Talking about features, there is a large difference in both of then. They’re           Slack   Microsoft Teams         Pricing model   Freemium Standard $6. 67 user/month (billed annually) Plus $12. 50 user/month (billed annually)   Freemium Office 365 Business Essentials $5 per user/month(billed annually) $12. 50 per user/month(billed annually) You can try both paid plans for free for 30 days       Message history limit   10K messages in Free plan, unlimited in Standard and Plus plans   Unlimited in all plans       Audio/video calls   Unlimited 1:1 voice and video calls in Free plan Conference calls for up to 15 participants in Paid plans   Voice/video calls with up to 250 people in a meeting.        Integrations   10 integrations limit in Free plan, 800+ integrations in paid plans   180+ apps and services (as of July 2018)       File storage limit   Free plan: 5GB file storage for a team Standard plan: 10GB per user Plus plan: 20GB per user   Free plan: 2 GB/user and 10GB of shared storage Paid plans: 1 TB per organization       Screen sharing   Unavailable in Free version, available in Standard and Plus versions   Available in all plans       Interface color options   Custom sidebar themes.    3 themes (light, dark, high contrast)       Conversation threads   Yes   Yes   Microsoft Teams integrations vs Slack integrations: Microsoft Teams and Slack take slightly different approaches to integration with other apps. Slack integrations: Slack boasts a ton of integrations with a variety of different apps—more than 800 for paid plans, to be exact. The sheer number and variety of apps available means that you can customize your Slack workspace to make your workflow seamless. Microsoft Teams integrations: While Slack offers more options for customization, Microsoft Teams takes a different approach—offering a full-fledged collaboration platform with many different functionalities built in from day one. Essentially, Teams isn’t meant to be a standalone tool. It’s a fully integrated Office 365 collaboration hub, allowing users to move seamlessly between tasks and apps within the Teams window.  Wrapping up: Here are some of our conclusions regarding Slack vs. Microsoft Teams. Pricing: Both Teams and Slack have freemium plans. When it comes to the paid plans, the cheapest Microsoft Teams plan is less expensive than Slack’s cheapest plan. MT wins this roound. Layout and design: The layout in Microsoft Teams has far too many tabs. On the other hand, there is less to see immediately in Slack because they want to improve their user interface. Moreover, Slack has more options to customize the app’s look. Messaging: Both Teams and Slack have different ways to send and receive messages, including threads. Microsoft Teams has more built-in options to format your text, and in return, Slack lets you set reminders for individual messages. File sharing and collaboration: Microsoft Teams lets you share Office files and work on them immediately from the workspace. Slack doesn’t come with the option of editing documents from the workspace, so you have to download files and open them in specific apps to edit them. Video calls: Both apps allow video calls and the feature works very well. However, Teams has a built-in video recording feature, which is really neat. Moreover, MT allows up to 250 people in a single call when you’re on a paid plan, compared to Slack which allows 15 people at a time. Integrations: While Microsoft Teams has excellent native integrations with Office and some third-party app integrations, Slack definitely wins in this department – it has more than 800 integrations that you can use. Summary: Both apps are a good choice but they are catered for different needs. If you want lots of third-party integrations and the ability to customize your app to a great extent go with Slack. On the other hand, Microsoft Teams works really well for companies that do a lot of work Office 365 and who already pay for that service. If you are planning to use free version, then Microsoft Teams would suit you the best because, there are are a lot more features in Microsoft Teams than Slack. May be this is the reason why, Microsoft Teams had a larger user base. "

    "body": "2020/05/20 - These days companies everywhere find themselves quickly changing how they work. With the culture shift that comes along with remote work, it’s fair to say that collaboration is already starting to be different. GitHub Education, always helps the next generation of developers to make their best in work. Now, more than ever, students need opportunities to sustain their growth. Github together with their partners Major League Hacking (MLH), solving this problem with a new program—the MLH Fellowship, Powered by GitHub. This remote program matches up pods of 8-10 students with open-source projects and mentors over a period of 12 weeks. Students will receive a stipend for the program through GitHub Sponsors.  Not just GitHub, many other tech companies will come together and fuel this ecosystem. To kick off the program, GitHub Education plans to support 100 MLH Fellows in the inaugural class of summer 2020. These are the other partners who’re joining this coalition Facebook, DEV, and the Royal Bank of Canada. This is how GitHub describes about MLH Fellowship GitHub’s vision: Workforce innovation to meet student demandEnterprises want to stay competitive with recent graduates, and internship programs often provide that edge. Internships also serve as a credential: For future hiring managers, an internship with a top tech company is a good indication of a quality candidate. But for students, many, many more of them apply for those coveted roles than there are positions to fill. For most students, a summer in Silicon Valley is often out of the question for those aspiring developers, maintainers, and engineering managers. In partnering with MLH, we’re looking to welcome a new global workforce that is trained in real-world workflows and collaboration CEO of MLH, Mike Swift, points to the program’s design around remote work and public projects:  Enabling students to spend their summer contributing to the software that runs the world is a unique   opportunity for them. They’ll work on meaningful projects with their peers under the guidance of some of the world’s most talented engineers. The remote nature of this program will democratize access to internships for countless students worldwide. The opportunity: Shape the future of workIn this moment, companies have the opportunity to affect how we learn, collaborate, and share for decades to come. We hope to see the results of these particular efforts in as little as 12 months when this year’s group of interns graduate.  Let’s keep education moving forward. Students, we got you. - GitHub Read to level-up your learning?: Apply to GitHub MLH Fellowship and join them from here Share your experience with GitHub Fellowship and your feedback about our article on twitter, Instagram, or mail us at support@devskrate. com.

Lets first talk about the XPS 15, The new XPS 15 design has seen a significant redesign after nearly 5 years and it now comes with a bigger 16:10 aspect ratio and trimmed down bezels, similar to that of Dell XPS 13. You can either pick a 4k or a regular FHD (1920 x 1200) display with a small webcam on top for Windows 10 Hello Facial Recognition. It also offers a fingerprint for authentication.     Powering this is the new 10th gen mobile processors from Intel which can be equipped up to a Core i9 and it also comes with an option for dedicated graphics namely the Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q for graphically intense task.     This laptop ditches ports like USB-A and HDMI in favor of USB-C and this laptop comes with two USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 support and a regular USB-C 3. 1 port, and full-size SD card reader. This laptop is quite thinner at 18mm high.    Talking about battery, Dell is promising “The longest battery life of any 15-inch laptop”, with up to 25 hours on the FHD display model and It also comes with Quad speaker setup(2 front facing and 2 at rear) for immersive sound experience. This laptop starts at $1,299. 99. Alongside the XPS 15, Dell reintroduced it’s slightly bigger XPS 17. It’s been nearly 10 years since we have seen an XPS 17 and as the name implies it’s a larger 17-inch laptop and dell claims that “The XPS 17 is the smallest 17-inch laptop on the planet”. Similar to the XPS 15 this laptop also comes with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a much smaller bezel.  This 17-inch laptop also comes new 10th gen intel processors, which can be equipped up to the new core i9 and at the GPU side of things, this can be equipped with either Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q or the more powerful RTX 2060. With this CPU and GPU combination Dell claims this laptop to be the “Most powerful XPS laptop ever”.  Talking about the ports, this comes with four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and a full-size SD card reader and the fact that it does not have any USB-A port is a bummer.  Dell has added a new thermal design to the XPS 17 with a custom vapor chamber, to improve airflow and sustain high performance for longer periods of time.  It also comes with Quad speaker setup(2 front facing and 2 at rear) for immersive sound experience. The new Dell XPS 17 will be available soon starting at $1,499. 99. "

As people say “History tends to repeat itself”, a somewhat similar thing has happened the Poco F2 pro is a rebranded Redmi K30 pro. What does the phone bring with it lets find out in this article? Key Specs:       Name   Specifications         Processor   Qualcomm Snapdragon 865       Rear Camera   Quad Cameras 64MP(Primary)+13MP(Ultra Wide)+5MP(Zoom Lens)+2MP(depth Sensor)       Front Camera   20MP(popup)       Display   6. 67 inches 60HZ AMOLED,180Hz touch sampling rate       Connectivity   5G, WIFI 6,Super Bluetooth       Battery   4700mAH(30W Fast charging)       Fingerprint   In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)       Charging   Type-C cable, with Fast charging   Design and Build Quality:The massive notch of the F1 is replaced by a fullscreen bezel-less experience on the front andhas an in-display fingerprint sensor on the front as well. The rear panel has a circular camera array and Poco branding, which is beautiful to look at. Both the front and back are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Display:This phone now comes with a glass sandwitch design put together by an aluminum frame, which is way superior compared to the polycarbonate build its predecessor(Poco F1) comes with. This phone comes with a 6. 67-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. We are disappointed to see a 60Hz display in 2020 but at least it comes with 180Hz touch sampling rate and a peak brightness close to 1200nits. This display also brings with it support for HDR 10+. We can also set different color types like Enhanced, Original, P3, sRGB.   Camera:The F2 Pro comes with a quad-camera array in the circular cutout on the rear. The primary sensor is the 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor, along with a 13MP (f/2. 4) ultra-wide-angle lens with 123-degree FOV, a 5MP telephoto macro camera and a 2MP depth sensor. The phone also supports 8k video capture. On the selfie side of things it comes with a 20MP pop-up camera with support for slow-motion video and other cool features. We think the pop-up cameras are not the one everyone liked.   Connectivity:This phone comes with the top of the line snapdragon 865 with support for WIFI 6,5G. This phone also supports super Bluetooth,NFC, GPS. It also comes with a 3. 5mm headphone jack at the top which is rear to see in flagships nowadays. Poco also includes an IR blaster to let you control home appliances. Hardware and Software:This phone is powered by top of the line Qualcomm’s snapdragon 865. This also has Liquid cooling 2. 0 to help the phone sustain high performance for longer periods and coming to software set if things, It runs MIUI 11 for Poco which is based on Android 10 out of the box. The feature offered by the Poco launcher is exactly similar to MIUI 11. The only difference is that this launcher offers a clutter-free app drawer. It will also get MIUI 14. Battery &amp; Charging:This phone comes with a huge 4,700 mAh battery and support for 30W fast charging, which promises to top up the entire phone in 63 minutes. We are not sure about the wireless charging as of now. Pricing:This phone comes in two configurations – 6GB+128GB and 8GB+256GB and has been priced starting at 499 euros (around Rs. 40,750). You will need to shell out 599 euros (around Rs. 48,900) forthe 8GB+256GB variant. Opinion:We think that the phone is overpriced for what it brings on board with it. We are really hoping for real poco series not the rebranded versions of redmi series. We really enjoyed poco F1 and we want the fire of POCO in it’s successors also. upto MIUI 14 "

    "body": "2020/05/12 - I’ve spent a good chunk of my workday so far creating AI-generated memes in seconds with just simple clicks. Usually I do make memes when I’m free but after knowing that I can generate memes using AI, I started testing the algorithm and results as pretty cool. Kudos to ImgFlip’s Ai based meme generator. Why this is interesting?At a glance, it looks like your random collection of meme templates. But those memes aren’t real, I mean not at all generated by humans. They are being created at that instance of time by an artificial intelligence (AI) ALgorithm that can understand meme creation technique and can generate some cool memes. You can directly ask for generating a meme with random template or else you can select a template out of 40 viral meme templates to generate a meme.  How it works?These captions are generated by a deep artificial neural network. Nothing about the text generation is hardcoded, except that the maximum text length is limited for sanity. The model uses character-level prediction, so you can specify prefix text of one or more characters to influence the text generated. Using someone’s name or other short text as a prefix works best. The network was trained using public images generated by users of the Imgflip Meme Generator for the top 48 most popular Meme Templates. Beware, no profanity filtering was done on the training data so you may encounter vulgarity. Basically, Imgflip’s neural network processed a lot of memes and then tried to predict what memes should look like. The results are often hilarious, and they certainly feel like real memes. Here are collection of some crazy memes generated there.      Try creating different memes and share with us on Twitter or Instagram.

    "title": "Espanso - Cross-platform Text Expander written in Rust",
    "body": "2020/05/08 - Snippet tools are incredibly useful. The idea is to save time that would have otherwise been wasted typing phrases, sentences or entire paragraphs. Espanso is an open source text template program for Windows, Mac and Linux that helps users save time. During the installation, you have the choice to add Espanso to “PATH” (Windows System Variable) and to enable it to auto-start with Windows. You will also need to restart the computer to get the program working. properly; I think it requires the restart to enable the “PATH” correctly. Start the program and you should see an icon on the system tray. Right-clicking on it allows you to disable it or exit the program. Espanso works in all applications including Notepad, Word, Firefox, Thunderbird, and more. Matches: Espanso uses the concept of Matches (keyword recognition) i. e. , when you type a word that’s present in the program’s settings, it triggers the application to substitute the keyword with its configured replacement. The official wiki explains the technical details rather well, but I’ll demonstrate how it works below for your convenience. Fire up a text editor or browser, or any other program that accepts text input. Type the word :espanso and it will magically be replaced with the phrase “Hi there!”. In this case “:espanso” is the keyword and “Hi There” is the replaced text.  If you haven’t guessed it already, Espanso is the Italian word for Expanded. IndicateTLS highlights TLS security protocol version in Firefox’s address bar Capture images and annotate them quickly with Draft NotesCapture images and annotate them quickly with Draft Notes So, how do we customize Espanso?Go to the application’s “Roaming” folder in your User directory. This folder contains a “default. yml” file. Open it using a text editor, e. g. Notepad works just fine. Espanso uses YAML syntax, which is very user-friendly. Look at the highlighted section in the screenshot below. That’s the match trigger and replacement which I mentioned in my example. Rules: The indentation is necessary for the syntax to work. So if your match isn’t being triggered correctly, check the spacing in the syntax. The other rule is to remember to use the : symbol. For e. g. :espanso vs espanso. The first one is correct, the latter won’t trigger the program. How to add new words to Espanso?: Let’s try adding a new one. Write a new trigger word and choose a replacement phrase. To make it easy, you can just copy the “espanso” trigger, paste it in a new line and edit it. Save the document, exit Espanso and start it again.

    "body": "2020/05/07 - You can finally add your own background to Microsoft Teams video chats. Designed for business and education, Teams includes group chat, video calling and collaboration tools, and has seen a spike in usage since countries and states have started directing residents to stay and work from home when possible to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. With the update to Microsoft’s collaboration tool, you can now pick a custom image as your video chat background. The Zoom video chat service also lets you pick your own custom background images for calls. But with recent concerns about Zoom security, some users are starting to look to other services such as Teams for their chats. How to change your video chat background in Microsoft Teams: Important catch: This feature is only available for scheduled meetings, according to Microsoft.    Start or or join a Teams meeting, from the Windows or Mac application (you can’t change your background on the web app at this point).     At the bottom of the screen, click or tap the three dots to go to your Meeting controls.     Select More actions &gt; Show background effects. Either select Blur to blur your background, or choose from the available images to replace it.     You’ll be able to preview your background to see how it looks. If you like it, hit Apply. That’s it!  In the future, you’ll also be able to create your own images, upload them to Teams, and then select them as a background image for your video chats, reports said. You can have video chats with up to 250 people in Microsoft Teams, and if your workplace or school has access to Office 365, you already have access to it. You can also check out a free version of Microsoft’s communication tool. "

    "body": "2020/04/30 - Feature list: UI changes Wallpapers Dark mode 2. 0 MI health app Improved Gestures Privacy enhancement Floating window Ads AIXiaomi Announces MIUI 12, Here is a quick overview and list of phones which is expected to get this update. Xiaomi in its recent keynote along with its phone announcement, it also the latest version of its software skin MIUI 12. It’s a slight redesign of its exciting MIUI 11 and has quite a lot of visual changes. Let’s see what features does this new UI brings to the table. 1. UI changes:Xiaomi has been working hard to make their UI as refined and as minimal as possible. One of the UI changes comes in the notification shade, now we change some simple basic settings like wifi, Bluetooth in the notification shade itself with a tiny window and talking about looks, it looks much similar to control center found on the IOS.   The use of pictorial images to represent the status and data visualization ends up bringing a fresh look to the UI and the app animation(Opening and Closing) has also gotten much smoother.   2. Wallpapers:Wallpapers are one of the biggest visual changes and Xiaomi is calling them ‘Super Wallpapers’ and they look very cool, their live wallpapers which are based on high precision 3D models ofearth and mars and the fact that they turn into night scene when dark mode is added is a bounce. The live wallpapers feature for now is only exclusive to High-End Xiaomi phones.   3. Dark Mode 2. 0:You might ask me that we already have a system-wide dark theme in MIUI 11 so what’s new in this, There are a good number of improvements in it. This time the company has worked to improve the readability to reduce eye strain and the text is now brighter and sharper. Dark mode also brings a new feature called ‘Wallpaper Dimming’ feature that will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper(It also supports this feature for custom wallpapers. )  4. MI Health App:Mi Health debuts in this new version of MIUI. This enables, The phone can track users steps, sleep, workouts, and other exercises but the fact that to enable the phone to do sleep tracking the phone should be in the same pillow is a bummer.   5. Improved Gesture:This UI update also brings with it a slight improvement in the gestures. It now has a much lengthy bar at the bottom and much refined animations to go along with it.   6. Privacy enhancement:Xiaomi this time along has followed a three-pronged approach to improve privacy in MIUI 12, namely Flare, Barbed Wire, and the Mask System. Firstly, the flare will keep track of the app behavior of all apps on your phone and will present you the list of apps that may be violating the privacy policy or misusing permissionsand offer tips to avoid the above mishaps.   The second one is Barbed Wire, in which it offers several permission options similar to Android 10 and gives us options like for permanently allow or only when app is in use or allow only once and it even shows the icon of which app is using what services.   The third one is the Mask system which lets users to create and share virtual ID’s when apps ask about the data, we saw a similar implementation in the Color OS 7 skin as well.   7. Floating window:Android 10 itself has the floating window feature, MI included it to miui.   8. Ads:Talking about the Ad situation in MIUI only time has the answer.   9. AI :AI feature is only available to china at present. These are some of the important features coming to Xiaomi devices through MIUI 12 update.

Booting problems like bootloop(Restarting when ubuntu is selected) or blank screen after selecting ubuntu in the grub. With My experience, I am giving here few fixes you may try. 1. Uncheck the PPT security in BIOS Firstly goto the BIOS (It depends on the system, for Dell press F12), then goto security, then goto PTT security and Uncheck it. Security -&gt; PTT Security and uncheck PTT OnClick Apply (I would recommend choosing Save as Custom User Settings), then OK, then Exit. This should acctuallly work. If this does not work, try the second method. 2. Boot from Advanced Options While booting from grub, you can see “Advanced Options for Ubuntu”. Select it and in that boot from the Old Kernel. You may find many things like  Ubuntu, with Linux 5. 4-generic Ubuntu, with Linux 5. 4-generic (recovery mode) Ubuntu, with Linux 4. *-generic Ubuntu, with Linux 4. *-generic (recovery mode)Boot with Linux 4. *-generic, don’t boot with recovery or any other options availabe additionally. Now, you will boot into Ubuntu:). Remember, this method is not a permanent fix, you can use Ubuntu inthis way as long as you find the permanent fix, this will not do anything from accessing all the features. Additional Info: Why method 2 is not a permanent fix, because Ubuntu uses Linux kernel 5. 4, so grub will boot from it by default. After booting in you can change the default kernel to boot, but be carefull while handling with the Kernel. "

Why Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas. Here are some Key Benefits of using VS Code -  Available on Mac, Linux, and Ofcourse Windows.  Edit, Build, and Debug very easily.  Highly configurable - Open-source project VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as NodeJS, JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.  Highly robust and Extensible.  High availability of industry and community-developed extensions.  Much loved dark themeInstalling Visual Studio CodeWe can download updated version of VS Code from their website - https://code. visualstudio. com/ Download from here - https://code. visualstudio. com/download Required Extensions for all developers: 1. Python extension by Microsoft - download  An extension with rich support for the Python language, including features such as linting, debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more! I personally use black code-formatter. we can configure it in our workspace settings in . vscode file. This helps to maintain code and code-formatting consistent in development.      Troubleshoot the code formatting plugin in python here   2. Java Extension by Mircosoft - download  Java Extension Pack is a collection of popular extensions that can help write, test and debug Java applications in Visual Studio Code. 3. Markdown Renderer Extension - download  Markdown Preview Enhanced is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities such as automatic scroll sync, math typesetting, mermaid, PlantUML, pandoc, PDF export, code chunk, presentation writer, etc. 4. Prettier Extension for JavaScript - download  It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. 5. ESLint - download  This will be useful to check JavaScript and TypeScript errors The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn’t provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven’t installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install. 6. CSS Peek - download  CSS Peek is a great tool if you keep forgetting what was a CSS class was used for. However, that could also mean that your CSS class names are not meaningful, or you have written too much “unmaintainable” code. Still, this is sure going to be handy if you are viewing/rewriting someone else’s code. 7. Debugger for Chrome - download  Debugger for Chrome is a great tool if you use a debugger in VSC. It allows you to launch an instance of Chrome navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Chrome. Using the URL parameter, you tell VSC which URL to either open or launch in Chrome. 8. Gitlens - download  GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more. 9. Git File History - download  This helps to quickly browse the history (edits and commits done by you and others) in a cool and interesting visualization.  you can try this in browser also. you just need to do these three steps.      Go to a file in GitHub (or GitLab, or Bitbucket)   Replace github. com with github. githistory. xyz   There’s no step three. you’ll love this.    10. Docker Extension - download  The Docker extension makes it easier to build apps that leverage Docker containers. The extension helps scaffold needed files, build Docker images, debug your app inside a container, and an explorer that makes it easy to take actions on containers and images such as start, stop, inspect, remove, and more. 11. SQL Formatter - download  This VS Code extension formats PostgreSQL SQL, using the Perl based pgFormatter tool.

    "body": "2020/04/23 - Moto after 4 years has come back to making flagship phones with its new edge series, It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus. Let’s see what Motorola has to offer in this article. Moto Edge Plus:The standout feature of this phone has to be its design, It’s an all-glass display with metal frame holding them together, The edges wrap around the edges with a punch hole at the top and in one word it looks gorgeous with two color variants to offer namely midnight megneta and solar black. Before taking a deep dive lets see the specs. Processor:	Qualcomm Snapdragon 865Rear Camera	Triple Cameras 108MP(with OIS) + 16MP(Ultra Wide + Macro) + 8MP(3x Zoom with OIS)front Camera	25MPDisplay	    6. 7 inches 90HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio: 21:9) FHD5G support	both mm and sub-6 band. Battery	    5000mAH(18W)Fingerprint	In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)Water Resistant	Water Resistant(IP 68)Charging	Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 15W) + 5W(Reverse Wireless Charging)RAM/ROM     12GB/128or256GB Display and battery:The display is a 6. 7 inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the phone comes with a 90HZ refresh rate but the resolution is only FHD(1080p), which is a bummer at this price point but it helps increase the battery efficiency and in this phone moto has provided a huge 5000mAh battery and moto claims it can last till 2 days. Camera:This phone comes with a total of four cameras three at the back and one inside the punch hole. The primary sensor is a 108MP Samsung sensor which we saw in the galaxy s20 ultra, This camera by default shoots at 27MP and it has OIS built-in for stable video. The second sensory is an 8MP three times zoom sensor and this also has OIS for better video as well as zoom. The third is a 16MP Ultra wide sensor to capture ultra-wide shots. The selfie camera is a 25MP shooter. This phone has all the hardware required for a good camera it ultimately comes down tocamera software. Software and Hardware:Talking about software, It comes with an almost stock-like experience with a few added features based on android 10, and moto is calling it “My UX”. In days where flagship smartphones are removing the headphone jack moto has it in this phone which is a great thing. The hardware also is top end with snapdragon 865, It also supports fast charging, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging and all other high-end features to compete against the top of galaxies and iPhones. Pricing:This phone is priced at 999. 99 dollars which converts to around 75k price, which is very expensive considering what this phone has to offer. If moto really wants to bring this phone to India it has to reduce the price to somewhere around 55k. Moto Edge:Edge is very similar to Edge plus with very few changes. The main shooter is 64MP instead of 108MP, the battery capacity is 4500mAH instead of 5000mAH, It only offers 4GB/6GB of RAM and it does not support any kind of wireless and reverse wireless charging on it but the key difference is that it comes with snapdragon 765 5G on board. This phone is priced at 699 EURO, which is 58,000 rupees. I think this phone is fairly overpriced and at this price we can get several other optionsfrom vendors like one plus, Xiaomi, etc, which can offer us a flagship experience. Both these phones are expected to launch in India after the pandemic has ended,what do you think about these phones "

Its strategy was always to launch a phone that brought with it a flagship experience but not so expensive as a flagship but as years passed by its pricing kept on increasing from generation to generation. So, is this new One plus 8 a “flagship killer or a wallet killer”, lets find out in this article.  Lets talk specs for a while, it’s powered by the top of the line Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, which comes with a 6. 55 inches AMOLED with a 90HZ refresh rate, which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display. (For people who are unaware of display mate its like DXO Mark for Displays).  Coming to the camera its a triple camera setup the main sensory and the wide angle are the same found on the one plus 7t which are 48MP and 16MP respectively and the third sensor is replaced by a macro lens to capture closeup shots. The selfie shooter is a 16MP sensor which is the same one found on the one plus 7t. The battery capacity is 4300 mAh.    The phones pricing in India at this point of time is unknown but if we consider the price of this phone in US,We can expect a price at about 53,000 Rupees which is almost 13,000 price increase from the one plus 7t which was 37,999 rupees at launch.     The 13k price increase brings a new design change to the front which is punch hole display with curved edges(similar to the one found in the galaxy s10). The same old 90hZ display which is much brighter for better outdoor use.  The phones also comes with a slightly improved stereo speakers setup with dolby atmos support. The standout feature of this phone has to be the support for 5G and wifi 6. Conclusion: I think that one plus, for this time has ended up making a wallet killer. If what you really want 5G we have much cheaper options from namely the realme X50 and if you want the smooth experience of oxygen OS. The older one plus phones namely the 7t can give you the same experience for much lesser price. One plus 8 is meant for people whose first priority is design, oxygen OS and 5G in a single package. "

    "title": "One Plus 8 pro - The Real Flagship",
    "body": "2020/04/15 - It has been 6 years since one plus has been making smartphones until last year the company has produced a lot of flagship killer but the company from the past year has changed its strategy to produce a true flagship with its one plus 7 pro and 7t pro they were good but lacked the bells and whistles that a true flagship from samsung and apple had. With this phone one plus is trying to tick all the boxes of a flagship. Did it succeed, let’s see in the article below. Before taking a deep dive into the phones, let’s see what specs this phone has to offer:       Name   Specifications         Processor   Qualcomm Snapdragon 865       Rear Camera   Quad Cameras 48MP(f/178) + 48MP(Ultra Wide) + 8MP(3x Zoom) + 5MP(Color Sensor)       front Camera   16MP       Display   6. 78 inches 120HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio:19. 8:9)       Connectivity   5G, WIFI 6 Support       Battery   4510mAH(30T warp charging)       Fingerprint   In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)       Water Resistant   Water Resistant(IP 68)       Charging   Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 30W) + 3W(Reverse Wireless Charging)   If you have carefully observed the specs, this phone includes an IP Rating as well as wireless charging. This shows that one plus is not trying to cut corners against the best of samsung and apple but instead giving it all to take them head on.    The phone pricing in India is not out yet but if we consider the US pricing which is 899$ converting it into INR we can estimate the price to be at around 68k with this price it still manages to undercut the iphone 11 and galaxy s20.   Talking about the design, it has a single punch hole curved display similar to galaxy s10.  The highlight of this phone has to be its 120Hz AMOLED display which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display. (For people who are unaware of DisplayMate its like DXO Mark for Displays).  Coming to the camera its a quad camera setup and on paper can take on the other flagships nicely.  The Build quality with its glass body attached together by a metal has always been good but this time it also added dust and water resistance which is rated as IP 68(fit enough to withstand dust, dirt and sand and are resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1. 5m underwater for up to thirty minutes).  Taking about battery life, this phone comes with a 4510mAH capacity which is fairly good enough. The performance is also great coming with snapdragon 865 processor. This phone also supports 5G and WIFI 6 making it a future proof phone. The software thats the oxygen OS gives the cleanest andriod experience. Conclusion: One Plus ended up making a really appealing flagship smartphone undercutting the likes samsung and apple by a good margin and offering way more specifications at this price point. "

    "body": "2020/04/02 - Google is killing another one of its experimental apps — Neighbourly. The company said it’s shutting down the app on May 12, as the project didn’t take off as expected. The search giant first unveiled the app in May 2018 as a test in the Indian city of Mumbai to let you explore your neighborhood with help from local experts. Later in November, it expanded its base to a few more cities in the country. However, it failed to gain traction, likely because it simply didn’t have enough users to deliver an engaging experience. It never even came out of beta. In an email sent to customers, Google mentioned that the community answered over a million questions related to their localities, but the project didn’t grow the way the company had hoped: We launched Neighbourly as a Beta app to connect you with your neighbors and make sharing local information more human and helpful. As a community, you’ve come together to celebrate local festivals, shared crucial information during floods, and answered over a million questions.  But Neighbourly hasn’t grown as we had hoped. In these difficult times, we believe that we can help more people by focusing on other Google apps that are already serving millions of people everyday. Google also pointed towards Google Maps Local Guide to help people in your region find answers related to the area. The announcement comes at an interesting time: Facebook just rolled out a ‘community help’ feature for people to request or offer assistance in their neighborhoods during the coronavirus crisis. The app is closing down on May 12; you’ll be able to download your Neighbourly content until October 12. Another one for the Google Graveyard. Post Credit: The Next Web "

    "title": "[update: India Specific Site]Google’s coronavirus website finally launches alongside enhanced search results",
    "body": "2020/04/02 - Google had launched a new India specific Caronavirus site containing Health Information, Safety and precautions tips, Data &amp; Insighs and Resources to help. It also contains National helpline toll free numbers. The site also contains state wise caronavirus infected list. [update ends]😊✌ 21 March, 2020One week ago, President Donald Trump held a press conference wherein he claimed Google would be building a screening website for the coronavirus that would direct people to testing sites. As we learned in the following days, that wasn’t true. Google’s sister company Verily did launch such a site, but only for the Bay Area and reportedly it only offered tests to a very small number of people. Google, however, did say it would launch some sort of website and after a small delay, it’s here. Alongside the website and potentially more importantly, Google will start providing more enhanced information cards for people who search for terms related to the coronavirus. There will be information tabs for symptoms, prevention, global statics, and locally relevant information. It will look a bit like this: The website is at google. com/covid19. It does have useful resources, including a card that mimics what you see above. Google’s post announcing the site says that you will be able to find “state-based information, safety and prevention tips, search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators and businesses. ” Google emphasizes that it’s pulling information from “authoritative” sources like the WHO and the CDC. It’s only available in English right now, but a Google spokesperson tells The Verge that Spanish language support is soon to follow. The site was also designed with accessibility in mind, including with the larger fonts that Google usually uses. The website has videos in ASL, a global map showing confirmed cases by country, and plenty of information about Google’s other relief efforts — plus some feel-good YouTube videos. Reading through that description, however, you’ll notice that it doesn’t include what Trump originally claimed it would. The nearest thing to finding a test is a drop-down menu that provides links to local websites — for example, choosing California provides a link to the California Department of Public Health. Right now, the CDC has a “self-checker” chatbot that Microsoft helped build, but the WSJ quoted an executive from a healthcare provider who put in a realistic context: “It’s just something consumers need now to help with anxiety. ” In other words, lots of big tech companies are making efforts to provide coronavirus-related support, but none of them are able to solve some of the biggest problems in the pandemic: access to testing and the impending crisis in our healthcare infrastructure. At some point in the future, Google may actually provide a questionnaire and information about local drive-thru testing locations. But a spokesperson says that the company won’t do so until there’s authoritative and trustworthy information on those sites. That could be a long time coming, unfortunately. "

    "title": "How to find trending apps in any country",
    "body": "2020/04/01 - Usually, to gain insight into what’s trending on the app stores, I either read prominent websites or look at the trending page on the app store. However, the problem arises when you have to look for global data. For instance, I am located in India and if I have to check what’s trending on the US Play Store, I would have to change my Google account location. Tedious! Recently, I stumbled upon a website that lets you check the trending apps in every country and even the app trend. It is quite helpful if you are an app developer and want to understand the trend of the market. It’s also helpful if you are a journalist who covers technology and currently trending apps. It helps you gauge the type of apps that are becoming popular within different countries and regions. How to find trending apps in any country?: Head over to this Similar Web tool and select the country. For instance, I have selected the United States as the country whose trending apps I want to see. Now, click on the “Go” button on the extreme right side. You will see the list of apps that are currently trending on the Google Play Store.  The website also lets you see trending apps on the Apple Play Store. In the first drop-down, you can select the store as “Apple App Store” and let other options as default. Click on the go button and it will populate the trending apps on the Apple store. Additionally, you will also see an “iPad/iPhone” toggle on just below the Go button.  There are a couple of different filters besides the App Store and the country. You can filter out apps based on categories like Fitness, Music, Productivity, etc. Moroever, you have a control to view popular paid apps as well. Additionally, the website shows you app trends as well. It’s a separate tab with multiple sections on it. One of the sections shows you apps that have become recently become popular and are new in the top 100 list. In addition to that, there’s a section that shows apps that have climbed their way and have increased their ranking in the top 100.  Another popular app research tool is AppBrain. In comparison, Similar Web doesn’t show you trends for an individual app, the number of downloads, etc. On the other hand, AppBrain is a furthermore intensive app data website. But, having said that if you write or develop apps, these 2 websites are a must-have bookmark on your browser. "

    "title": "4 steps you should take to secure your Gmail account",
    "body": "2020/03/31 - From bank statements to personal letters, and even password reset requests, your Gmail account holds an abundance of personal information. If someone were to access it, they’d effectively have access to the rest of your online identity. Instead of just hoping that hackers don’t find you, take 10 minutes and secure your Gmail account right now. Use a strong password: I suspect we’re all guilty of reusing simple passwords at some point – I admit that I used to. But reusing passwords across multiple sites and services is just asking for your accounts to be hacked. All it takes is a leak or breach at one service, and hackers will begin trying to sign in to all of your accounts. It’s time to step up your password game. Use unique, randomly generated passwords, for every online account you have. Keeping track of all those passwords is easy when you use a password manager. We have a roundup of the best password managers available, both free and paid, if you need help with deciding which one to use. To change your Google account password, visit the Google account security page and click on Password under the Signing in to Google section. Verify your password if prompted, then enter your new password – generated by your password manager – and click Change password. Enable two-step verification: Without two-step verification, also commonly called two-factor authentication, hackers only need your password to access your entire Google account – including YouTube, Gmail and Google Pay. And remember, if you reuse the same password for multiple services, they could get it from a data breach or through a phishing scam. With two-step verification, sometimes called two-factor authentication, hackers would need your password and a randomly generated six-digit passcode or physical access to your phone before they could gain access to your account. Turn on 2SV by visiting your Google account security page and clicking on 2-Step Verification.  Follow the prompts until you reach the section in the screenshot above. Once there, decide whether you want to receive push alerts in the Gmail app to approve login requests (the default option), or if you want to use random passcodes. Using alerts in the Gmail app is easier, but it means you have to have your phone nearby at all times. You’ll also need a connection to approve the alert. So, if you’re somewhere where you have no bars – like on a plane, for instance – you’ll need to be connected to Wi-Fi. If you choose to use a passcode, you can receive it via text message or access it in a password manager. I use a password manager to manage my 2SV codes so I can access the codes on any device, regardless of whether I have a data connection on my phone. If you opt to use alerts, click Try it now. You should receive an alert on the phone that was listed on the screen. Follow the rest of the prompts to complete setup. If you want to use passcodes, however, click on Choose another option and then Text message or voice call. Enter your phone number, and then enter the code to activate two-step verification. After entering the code and clicking a few more buttons, 2SV will be turned on.  But, wait, you’re not done yet. Though 2SV via texted passcodes is more secure than not using 2SV at all, I recommend using push alerts if possible. SIM-swap fraud is becoming more common, allowing hackers to take over your phone number and receive 2SV codes meant for you. If you must rely on passcodes, take a few extra minutes and set up an Authenticator app for your Google account. You can either use Google’s Authenticator app or a password manager. Click on Set Up under the Authenticator app section and then select the type of phone you use. Use your preferred app to scan the QR code, then enter the passcode generated by your app to verify everything is set up properly and you’re done.  Quick side note: There’s yet another, even more secure option for locking down your Google account that uses a physical security key which you can read more about here. For most people, however, carrying around an extra device isn’t a realistic option. At a minimum, you should turn on 2SV. Phew. That was a lot of work, but trust me, it’s worth it. Check your backup contact methods: Since the time that you first set up your Gmail account, you may have changed your phone number, or ditched an old email account. So it’s a good idea to double-check your backup contact methods. This is what Google will use should you get locked out of your account to verify you’re the account owner. Visit this page and look for the section titled Ways we can verify it’s you. Click on each section – Recovery phone, Recovery email and Security question – and update them with current information.  Again, if this information is out of date and you get locked out of your account, Google won’t be able to verify you own the account. Look at account activity: It’s possible that a hacker (or an ex) is accessing your account without your knowledge. To check, sign in to your Gmail account and scroll to the bottom of the page. You’ll see a line that says “Last account activity…” At the end of that line, click Details to see when, how and where your account is being used. If you suspect any unkosher activity, click on the button labeled Sign out of all other Gmail web sessions and immediately change your password. Now that you’ve secured your Gmail account, take a few more minutes to lock down your Amazon account. Then, do the same for your Facebook account and your Apple account while you’re at it. "

    "body": "2020/03/30 - Google chrome is one of the most used popular browsers. Firefox has improved a lot lately and is a better choice specially from the privacy point of view. However, if you are an ardent fan of Google Chrome, I won’t force you to ditch Chrome and move to Firefox. Ofcourse chrome is available for linux, but Google Chrome is not an open source and if you try to install Google Chrome from Ubuntu Software Center, you won’t find it there. It will probably suggest installing Chromium (the open source project Chrome is derived from). Chromium is similar to Chrome but it’s still not the real Google Chrome. . Now, we wil see the installation of google chrome. There are two methods to install Google Chrome.  Graphical install Command line install1. Graphical method [Begginer’s method]: If you are new to ubuntu and Linux world, this method is preferable(If you interested in administration, you can give a try with command line)Firstly go to the official website for downloading chrome. Download Google chrome You will see a download link there, now click the “Download chrome” button to download.  Now, you can see tat it is asking to select between two versions.  If you want to install chrome for other linux systems like Fedora, openSUSE download the “rpm package”, but we are now installing it for Ubuntu, download the ubuntu package. After downloading, open the downloaded file by double clicking it. Now,Ubuntu software center is opened and chrome will be staged for installation.  Now, just press “install”, google chrome will be installed. 2. Command line Method (Advanced or Interested user’s): This process is generally annoying for begginer users. So, follow the below steps carefully. To install chrome we need to download it. wget https://dl. google. com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64. debType the command in he terminal After the download process is finised, try to install it using the following command in the directory where you have downloaded sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64. debThat’s it, your system will be installed with chrome!!Coming to updating the chrome, you can update it while you are updatong your systems.

    "body": "2020/03/21 - Microsoft has started testing its Project xCloud game streaming service for Windows 10 PCs this week. The software giant is making the preview version, which lets you stream Xbox games to a PC, available to all Microsoft employees. The Verge has been able to obtain exclusive screenshots of how xCloud will work on PCs. Microsoft has developed an Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows 10 that will be available in the Windows Store. Much like the Android or iOS versions, the app requires a Bluetooth Xbox One controller, a Microsoft account, and a good internet connection. The PC app will also support streaming games from an Xbox One console locally or remotely, instead of using Microsoft’s xCloud server blades. There are a variety of games available to Microsoft employees to test, but the app is currently limited to 720p streams for now. “This internal preview is running at 720p resolution with 1080p just around the corner,” reveals an internal Microsoft support note. The experience is very similar to what is available on Android and iOS, even down to the user interface and the way you access and stream games. It certainly looks ready to be tested broadly, and it’s likely that Microsoft will roll this out to external Xbox testers soon. Microsoft also recently upgraded its xCloud server blades to include eight Xbox One S consoles in a single server instance. That’s up from the four the company was previously testing. &lt;img src=”/assets/images/microsoft/xcloudblade. jpg” title=”Microsoft’s xCloud Server” alt=”Microsoft’s xCloud Server”;”/&gt; Microsoft is now working to eventually transition these xCloud servers to the Xbox Series X processor. This next-gen processor is far more powerful and capable of running four Xbox One S game sessions simultaneously on a single chip. It also includes a new built-in video encoder that is up to six times faster than the current external encoder that Microsoft uses on existing xCloud servers. Microsoft has committed to launching xCloud this year, with PS4 controller support and this Windows 10 streaming on the way. The Xbox maker is planning to integrate Project xCloud with Xbox Game Pass later this year, allowing players to stream games from the company’s subscription service directly from the cloud. *image and post credits to The Verge "

The design its the same one as the previous gen iPad Pro and you will not be able to identify the previous from the latest one by just seeing the front which is covered with bezelless screen with a screen to body ratio of just below 83%.  2. Talking about the screen its the same old IPS LCD panel, with 120hz refresh rate which is found in the previous generation of iPad Pro. We would like to have seen an Oled panel with the same 120hz refresh rate, but thats kind a nitpicking.  3. Good froward taught about the back side the iPad Pro has got 2 new sensors, an ultra wide sensor of 12MP and Lidar sensor to aid with depth sensing and ARKIT stuffattached in the same fashion like the iPhone 11.  4. Talking about the Processing power,the iPad Pro is powered by A12Z Bionic Chipset which according to apple is more powerful than windows PC. Going by the previous gen iPad Pro the claims might end up becoming true. .  Conclusion : Is the new iPad Pro worth paying attention to ? The simple answer would be Yes,The iPad Pro is trying to be the everything machine be it a tablet or an laptop. It already was a great tablet but talking about laptop apple is trying its best thats evident by the fact that it now Provides Proper cursor support(mouse) for the iPad Pro and it has a smart keyboard which has a trackpad below the keyboard now its all upto the iPad OS which decides whether the iPad Pro can really be a computer for all intensive purposes.

    "body": "2020/03/09 - Generally, many developers prefer to use either linux or mac. But, mac is a very costly thing where students cannot afford, but it is secured. Now coming to linux, we can’t just define it. It is very addictable using linux.  1. Performance:: If we talk about performance, Linux runs faster than windows, even with the improved graphics compared to previous it is faster. If we open android studio in windows whole system goes down, but in linux we can able to run some other programs parallelly. 2. Updates:: Windows updates are very irritating, they need need to reboot for every update and it takes a lot of time to update i. e reboot. But in linux the updates are very fast and very rare updates need reboot that too it takes very less time. 3. Flavours:: Windows only has one theme, and which is less customizable. Linux has many flavours and many of them are highly customizable. Some of them are Linux mint, Ubuntu, Kali Linux and many more. . 4. Security:: No system is safe, when comes to security, though Linux is more secure compared to Windows. There are various constraints for this.  Windows is widely is used OS, so it is a target.  Windows is preparatory software i. e source code is hidden, so bugs and flaws can only fixed by the company. But Linux is opensource so anyone can fix it. 5. Support:: Microsoft Windows support isn’t bad, but linux has more forums and chatroom’s and websites where support comes from enthusiastic, where as for windows we should relay on the Company forums where employees give answers much time.

    "title": "How to Rank on First Page of Google",
    "body": "2020/03/03 - As we all know, the biggest challenge in internet marketing is getting traffic to your website. However difficult it may be, it is a must if you want to be successful. You could pay for Google AdWords, and pray that your campaign doesn’t get slapped by Google, or you could spend a few extra minutes every day, and get a better listing with more traffic for free. So how did I get my listing on the first page of Google? I am going to show you in 5 simple steps. Ok, here it goes: Step 1Create a blog – 10 minutes unless you already have a blog or website. Setting up a blog is very easy. Go to Blogger, register for a free Blogger account, choose a name for your blog (being very careful to give a name that applies to what you will be writing articles about), write your first post to introduce the blog, and then move on to step 2. Step 2Write an article or press release – 10-30 minutes depending on the length. Be careful not to “sell” anything in your article. You should be giving advice, reviewing a product, or something of that nature. Make sure you place a link to your blog at the end of the article in the bio box. Step 3Create a Title for your article and make sure that it is a popular phrase – one that will be searched for. You can use the free keyword tools for this. You want to search for your phrase using quotes (“), and look at the results number at the top right of the search results — if the results are under 5000, and there are people paying for ads using that search term (look for the sponsored listings on the right hand side), then chances are you have found a winner. Use that for the name of your article. Always write your article and save it to your computer, as you will want to submit it to more than one article directory. Copy/paste your article in to 4 or 5 free article submission sites, and then copy and paste it to your blog using the same title as the “Blog Post Title”. If you prefer to just link from your blog to the article, you can do that as well, but the idea is not just posting to article directories, it is adding “important” content to your blog. Once you have completed this step, move on to step 4. Step 4Many of the article submission sites allow you to use the “Add This” feature, which allows you to submit your article link to Social Networking Sites. Many online marketers are realizing the importance of doing this, so I would not skip this step. Step 5Search for your title in 24 hours and find it on the first page of Google. Folks, it does not get any better than this. Imagine having 10-20 articles listed per month. Do you know how much traffic that would create? And to think that if you write good content, your articles could show up for months or years to come! The great thing about this is that even if you have never written an article in your life, once you write one, and it gets listed by Google, you will be hooked. And don’t forget, you are getting all of this accomplished absolutely free. Forget about all of the SEO, and maintaining a website. Choose your title wisely, and you will be successful. "

    "title": "Challenges Faced By Android App Developers",
    "body": "2020/03/02 - While developing mobile apps, businesses target Android due to its massive worldwide mobile operating system market share. Alphabet has made Android available as an open source mobile platform. Also, it updates the mobile operating system at regular intervals with new features and enhancements. But the penetration rate of individual versions of the mobile operating system differs. Alphabet does not regulate the Android smartphones, tablets, and phablets manufactured by various companies. Hence, the devices manufactured by different companies come with varying hardware features despite being powered by the same version of Android. That is why; it becomes essential for developers build mobile apps by targeting a wide range of devices powered by different versions of Android. While planning, developing, and testing the mobile app, they need to focus extensively on its accessibility, functionality, performance, usability, and security of the mobile app to keep the users engaged regardless of their choice of Android device. Also, they need to explore ways to make the app deliver personalized user experience across varying devices and operating system version. They further need to address a number of common challenges to develop a robust Android app. Understanding 7 Common Challenges Faced by Android App Developers1) Software FragmentationAs mentioned earlier, the market share of individual versions of Android differs. According to the latest data released by Google, the most recent version of its mobile operating system – Nougat – has a market share lower than its predecessors – Marshmallow, Lollipop and KitKat. Each new version of Android comes with several new features and enhancements. The developers have to include specific features in the app to make it deliver optimal user experience by taking advantage of these new features. At the same time, they also need to ensure that the app delivers rich and personalized user experience on devices powered by older versions of Android. The developers have to target multiple versions of Android to make the application popular and profitable in the short run. 2) Varying Hardware FeaturesUnlike other mobile operating systems, Android is open source. Alphabet allows device manufacturers to customize its operating system according to their specific needs. Also, it does not regulate the Android devices launched by various manufacturers. Hence, the devices come with varying hardware features despite being powered by the same version of Android. For instance, two devices powered by Android Nougat may differ from each other in the category of display screen size, resolution, camera and other hardware features. While developing an Android app, the developers need to ensure that it delivers personalized experience to each user by accessing all hardware features of his device. 3) No Uniform User Interface Designing Process or RulesGoogle has not released any common user interface (UI) designing process or rules for the mobile app developers. Hence, most developers build Android apps without following any standard UI development process or rules. When the developers create custom UI interfaces in their own way, the apps do not look or function consistently across different devices. The incompatibility and diversity of the UI affects the user experience delivered by the Android app directly. The smart developers opt for responsive layout to keep the UI consistent across many devices. Also, the developers have to test the UI of their mobile app comprehensively by combining both real devices and emulators. But often developers find it daunting to design a UI that make the app look consistent across various Android devices. 4) API IncompatibilityMost developers use third-party APIs to enhance the mobile app’s functionality and interoperability. But the quality of third-party APIs available for Android app developers differs. Some APIs are designed for a particular version of Android. Hence, these APIs do not work on devices powered by different versions of the mobile operating system. The developers have to explore ways to make a single API work on different versions of Android. But they often find it challenging to make the app work smoothly on different Android devices with the same set of APIs. 5) Security FlawsIts open source nature makes it easier for device manufacturers to customize Android according to their specific needs. But the openness and its massive market share made Android vulnerable to frequent security attacks. There are many instances when security of millions of Android devices has been impacted by security flaws or bugs like Stagefright, ‘Certifi-gate’ mRST, FakeID, Installer Hijacking and TowelRoot. The developers have to include robust security features in the application and use latest encryption mechanism to keep the user information secure despite targeted security attacks and security flaws in Android. 6) Android Search Engine VisibilityThe latest data posted on various website depict that Google Play Store has a much higher number of mobile apps than Apple App Store. Also, a large percentage of Android device users prefer free apps to paid apps. Hence, the developers have to promote their mobile apps aggressively to accomplish higher download numbers and implement app monetization options. They also need to implement a comprehensive digital marketing strategy to promote the app by targeting the most relevant users. Many developers have to avail the services of digital marketing professionals to promote their apps aggressively. 7) Patent IssuesThe users have option to choose from several Android apps offering identical features and functionalities. But developers often find it daunting to build apps with unique features and functionality. They often include features and functionalities in the app that make it similar to a number of apps available in the same category in the Play store. Unlike Apple, Google does not implement stringent guidelines to evaluate the quality of new apps being submitted to its app store. Lack of standardized quality assessment guidelines often make developers address issues related to patent. Some developers have to design and modify their apps in future to avoid patent issues. Most Android app developers nowadays work in agile development environment to build Android apps rapidly. They have to coordinate consistently with QA professionals, and participate actively in the mobile app testing process. Hence, the developers also need to address a number of common issues in Android app testing. "

    "title": "Some new Android 11 Features for developers",
    "body": "2020/02/28 - Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. 1. 5G experiences: 5G brings consistently faster speeds and lower latency to more users around the world. With 5G you can extend your Wi-Fi app experiences – such as streaming 4K video or loading higher-res game assets – to mobile users, or you can build new experiences designed specifically for 5G.  Dynamic meteredness API - with this API you can check whether the connection is unmetered, and if so, offer higher resolution or quality that may use more data. The API to include cellular networks, so that you can identify users whose carriers are offering truly unmetered data while connected to the carrier’s 5G network.  Bandwidth estimator API - API for 5G to make it easier to check the downstream/upstream bandwidth, without needing to poll the network or compute your own estimate. If the modem doesn’t provide support, we make a default estimation based on the current connection. 2. New screen types: Device makers like POCO, RealMe, Xiaomi, Nokia etc. . continuing to innovate by bringing exciting new form-factors and device screens to market. Extended support for these in the platform, with APIs to let you optimize your apps.  Pinhole and waterfall screens - Apps can manage pinhole screens and waterfall screens using the existing display cutout APIs. If you want, a new API lets your app use the entire waterfall screen including the edges, with insets to help you manage interaction near the edges. 3. Privacy:  Scoped storage - Google continued it’s work to better protect app and user data on external storage, and made further improvements to help developers migrate more easily. This preview release includes several enhancements, such as opt-in raw file path access for media, updated DocumentsUI, and batch edit operations in MediaStore. Along with these technical changes, based on your input, we are also giving you more time to make the migration and the changes will apply to your apps when they target Android 11. 4. Security:  Biometrics - It has expanded it’s biometrics support to meet the needs of a wider range of devices. BiometricPrompt now supports three authenticator types with different levels of granularity – strong, weak, and device credential. It also decoupled the BiometricPrompt flow from the app’s Activity lifecycle to make it easier to integrate with various app architectures, and to improve the transaction UI. All apps using biometric auth should move to the BiometricPrompt APIs, which are also available in AndroidX for compatibility with earlier versions of Android.  Platform hardening - It expanded use of compiler-based sanitizers in security-critical components, including BoundSan, IntSan, CFI, and Shadow-Call Stack. It is also enabling heap pointer tagging for apps targeting Android 11 or higher, to help apps catch memory issues in production. These hardening improvements may surface more repeatable/reproducible app crashes in your code. It has used HWAsan to find and fix many memory errors in the system, and it now offer HWAsan-enabled system images to help you find such issues in your apps.  Secure storage and sharing of data - Apps can now share data blobs easily and more safely with other apps through a BlobstoreManager. The Blob store is ideal for use-cases like sharing ML models among multiple apps for the same user.  Identity credentials - Android 11 adds platform support for secure storage and retrieval of verifiable identification documents, such as ISO 18013-5 compliant Mobile Driving Licenses. 5. App compatibility:  Easier testing and debugging - To help you test for compatibility, it had made many of the breaking changes toggleable - meaning that you can force-enable or disable the changes individually from Developer options or adb. With this change, there’s no longer a need to change targetSdkVersion or recompile your app for basic testing.  Check out the details here. There are also Updated greylists, Dynamic resource loader, New platform stability milestone in the new preview. There are some improvements in Connectivity like Call screening service improvements, Wi-Fi suggestion API enhancements, Passpoint enhancements and Image and camera improvements like HEIF animated drawables, Native image decoder, Muting during camera capture, Bokeh modes. source: Turning it up to 11: the first Developer Preview of Android 11 "

    "body": "2020/02/20 - Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. Google released the first developer preview for Android 11 and it’s a very earl stage and it comes with a fair features and changes. Let’s get started with 7 cool features on Android 11. . 1. Chat Bubbles: Chat bubbles first appeared back with Android Q beta versions, but it was not released with the stable version. But now it was released with the Android R’s first developer beta. Chat bubbles are similar to Facebook Messenger’s Chat Heads feature. It shows a bubble when you get a new message.  Generally, chat bubbles can be used by any messaging apps, but as of now only Google Messages and Gmail apps are using it. You can open a chat bubble for a conversation by simply long-pressing on a message notification and tapping on ‘Show in chat bubble’. 2. Insert images into notification replies: With this you can copy/paste, you can now insert assets directly into notification inline replies to enable richer communication as well as in the app itself. You’ll see image copy support in Chrome and image paste support via Gboard clipboard. 3. Improved Permissions: With Android 11, Google has made location permissions even more strict. In Android 11, whenever an app requests a permission related to location, microphone, or camera, the user-facing permissions dialog contains an option called Only this time, as shown in Figure. If you selects this option in the dialog, you have granted the app a temporary one-time permission.  4. Native Screen Recorder: Now you can access the built-in screen recorder functionality from the Quick Settings panel. Tapping on this starts a 3 second timer before the screen starts being recorded. There’s also a handy notification to stop, pause, or cancel the screen record.  5. Improved Do Not Disturb: Android 11 also brings improvements to Do Not Disturb — mostly in that it gives better support for managing DND exceptions. You can set do not disturb exceptions for particular callers, specific apps, or just allow alarms and reminders to ring regardless of the DND status on your phone. 6. Scheduled Dark Mode: In android 10 Dark mode has been introuduced, system-wide. Now, it has some improvements like Scheduling it like  You can turn it on at sunset and can turn at sun rise.  You can also turn it on or of at a specific time. 7. Pin Apps in the Share Menu: You can now pin your apps, that you share the most content with. Now these cannot bu replaced by just random apps that are installed in your device. Other Changes and Features:  Conversations : Dedicated conversations section in the notification shade - users can instantly find their ongoing conversations with people in their favorite apps. "

Requirements for PythonTelegramBot :: Firstly, get your bot a token and a username. Search for “botfather” in telegram. Now follow the instructions in the BotFather. . This is the link for the official BotFather https://t. me/BotFather  Rember the username is unique, so if the username is taken, try another one.  Remember the API_TOKEN is confidential, secure it.  Else your bot can be controlled by others.    Now we need to install some libraries for getting startedpip3 install telebot pip3 install python-telegram-bot Our first program :: Here is the simple bot which echo’s what you sent to it.  #!/usr/bin/python # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.  # It echoes any incoming text messages.   import telebot       API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'       bot = telebot.

Just send anything and I'll send the same thing to you!\n )             # Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text']) @bot. message_handler(func=lambda message: True) def echo_message(message): bot. reply_to(message, message. text)           bot. polling()Now run the code by python3 file_name. py This is a simple echo bot. What ever the message you send to it, it sends you the same message.  Below are some predefined commands for our bot, so with out typing the whole sentence we can just type the command for the output.   @bot. message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])    Below this we should write the function that should be executed when the command is sent.  Till now we have written a simple program. Deploying PythonTelegramBot in Heroku: For deploying our bot we will use Flask, because for contacting bot we use webhooks method. So, to install flask use, pip3 install flask After installing we should change our code a little bit so as to work with flask.  server = Flask(__name__) PORT = int(os. environ. get('PORT', '8443'))Use the below code at the end of the application. @server. route('/' + API_TOKEN, methods=['POST']) def getMessage():   bot. process_new_updates([telebot. types. Update. de_json(request. stream. read(). decode( utf-8 ))])   return  ! , 200   @server. route( / ) def webhook():   bot. remove_webhook()   bot. set_webhook(url='Your_App_Name_Link_Here' + API_TOKEN)   return  ! , 200   if __name__ ==  __main__ : server. run(host= 0. 0. 0. 0 , port=int(os. environ. get('PORT', 5000)))After this the final code looks like  #!/usr/bin/python # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.  # It echoes any incoming text messages.   import telebot from flask import Flask, request import os API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'       bot = telebot.

So to get the librares use pip3 freeze requirements. txt You can see the libraries in “requirements. txt”. Don’t remove the libraries that you don’t know as they are dependent libraries. Now we should create a “Procfile” and type this code in that file web: python3 file_name. py Don’t change name of “requirements. txt” and “Procfile”(‘P’ is capital). Now, open github and create your repository, after that upload your file_name. py,requirements. txt and Procfile to github. Signup/Signin to heroku and Create a new app. Now, go to the Deploy section and now connect to github, then after type your repository name and connect it. Every thing is done. You are set to goNow press come down and press deploy branch. After successfull deployment you can use your bot. You can get your app name from settings section in heroku. "

    "title": "Creating browser extensions",
    "body": "1999/05/17 - Writing extensions is not that difficult, if you had an implementation with you and if you know basic web technologies like html, css and js, it is quiet enough for building a basic extension. In this tutorial we will build a basic chrome extension that allows the user to change the background color of any page on DevsKrate. com. Before getting started, know the basic things. When you click on an extension, we get a popup, it is a html file. We need to design the html page and the script behind it.  Firstly create a directory with the name of your extension. Let us name our extension as “dev example”. Create the Manifest file: Every extension start from their manifest file, so create a manifest. json and include the following code. {  name :  dev example ,  version :  1. 0 ,  description :  First extension example! ,  manifest_version : 2}The manifest file is the blueprint for the Extension. It tells the browser engine what version of the Extension API the Extension expects, the name and description of the Extension, and lots of other details.  Now open chrome and enter chrome://extensions in the url bar to open chrome extensions page or it can be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.  Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.  Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory. Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic toolbar icon will be created for the extension. Add Instruction: Now the second step is to add the instructions(script) what our extension needs to do. Before that we need to include the background script in the manifest file. Remember Background scripts, and many other important components, must be registered in the manifest. Registering a background script in the manifest tells the extension which file to reference, and how that file should behave. Update the manifest file with the below code: {  name :  dev example ,  version :  1. 0 ,  description :  First extension example! ,  background : {   scripts : [ background. js ],   persistent : false },  manifest_version : 2}Now create background. js file and then include the below code. It sets the background color. chrome. runtime. onInstalled. addListener(function() {  chrome. storage. sync. set({color: '#3aa757'}, function() {   console. log( The color is green.  );  });}); This script uses storage API for storing the color values. Including storage API and other API’s we should give permission in the manifest file. So include the following code in the manifest. json.   { name :  dev example , version :  1. 0 , description :  First extension example! , permissions : [ storage ], background : {  scripts : [ background. js ],  persistent : false}, manifest_version : 2}   Introduce a User Interface: Extensions can have many forms of a user interface, but this one will use a popup. Create a file named popup. html in the extension directory. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;style&gt;    button {     height: 30px;     width: 30px;     outline: none;    }   &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;button id= changeColor &gt;&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Now same as the background. js script, we should mention the popup. html in the manifest under page_action, like   page_action : {   default_popup :  popup. html },    We should also include the icons for our extensions in the manifest. json file as   default_icon : {    16 :  images/get_started16. png ,    32 :  images/get_started32. png ,    48 :  images/get_started48. png ,    128 :  images/get_started128. png   }    Download the images here.   There is also need of images for permissions warning, and favicon. These images are designated in the manifest. json under icons   icons : {   16 :  images/get_started16. png ,   32 :  images/get_started32. png ,   48 :  images/get_started48. png ,   128 :  images/get_started128. png  },    Add declared rules to the background. js script with the declarativeContent API within the runtime. onInstalled listener event.   chrome. declarativeContent. onPageChanged. removeRules(undefined, function() {  chrome. declarativeContent. onPageChanged. addRules([{   conditions: [new chrome. declarativeContent. PageStateMatcher({    pageUrl: {hostEquals: 'developer. chrome. com'},   })   ],     actions: [new chrome. declarativeContent. ShowPageAction()]  }]); });    The extension will need permission to access the declarativeContent API in its manifest. json.   { name :  Getting Started Example ,. . .  permissions : [ declarativeContent ,  storage ],. . . }   The browser will now show a full-color page action icon in the browser toolbar when users navigate to a URL that contains DevsKrate. com. When the icon is full-color, users can click it to view popup. html.  The last step for the popup UI is adding color to the button. Create and add a file called popup. js with the following code to the extension directory.   let changeColor = document. getElementById('changeColor');chrome. storage. sync. get('color', function(data) { changeColor. style. backgroundColor = data. color; changeColor. setAttribute('value', data. color);});    This code grabs the button from popup. html and requests the color value from storage. It then applies the color as the background of the button. Include a script to popup. js in popup. html.    &lt;script src= popup. js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;   Layer Logic: The extension now knows the popup should be only available to website DevsKrate. com and displays a colored button when the website is opened, but needs logic for further user interaction. Update popup. js and include the following code  changeColor. onclick = function(element) {  let color = element. target. value;  chrome. tabs. query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {   chrome. tabs. executeScript(     tabs[0]. id,     {code: 'document. body. style. backgroundColor =  ' + color + ' ;'});  }); };The updated code adds an onclick event the button. This turns the background color of the page the same color as the button.  The manifest. json will need the activeTab permission to allow the extension temporary access to the tabs API. This enables the extension to call tabs. executeScript.    permissions : [ activeTab ,  declarativeContent ,  storage ]    The extension is now fully functional! Reload the extension, refresh this page, open the popup and click the button to turn it green! However, some users may want to change the background to a different color, so we need to provide options to the users.  Users Options: The extension currently only allows users to change the background to green. Including an options page gives users more control over the extension’s functionality, further customizing their browsing experience.  Create options. html and include the following code&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;style&gt;    button {     height: 30px;     width: 30px;     outline: none;     margin: 10px;    }   &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;div id= buttonDiv &gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Choose a different background color!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;script src= options. js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/html&gt;Then register this in the manifest. json page by adding this line, in the middle.  options_page :  options. html ,Now everything is fine, but if user goes the options. html page and selects the color, we need to change it, so we need a script for it. Create a options. js file in the directory. let page = document. getElementById('buttonDiv'); const kButtonColors = ['#3aa757', '#e8453c', '#f9bb2d', '#4688f1']; function constructOptions(kButtonColors) {  for (let item of kButtonColors) {   let button = document. createElement('button');   button. style. backgroundColor = item;   button. addEventListener('click', function() {    chrome. storage. sync. set({color: item}, function() {     console. log('color is ' + item);    })   });   page. appendChild(button);  } } constructOptions(kButtonColors);Just refresh the extension!!, kudos you have built a basic extension. Test by going to DevsKrate. com, it will work for all the pages of the Domain, check it out. It will not work for the article(posts) pages because we have a dark theme for our articles, so you need to give special permissions to overwrite it and give the background color. "

    "title": "What is the difference between Scholarship and Fellowship?",
    "body": "1998/05/24 - Both scholarship and fellowship in general assume a financial aid for students and researchers, or any individual with an interest to search, find and research something new. Scholarships and fellowships are instituted by a University, a research center, academic institution, laboratory, government or a foundation. Main difference between Scholarship and FellowshipThe most important difference between scholarship and fellowship is that the term scholarship always means that there is a financial aid available. So there is no scholarship without financial aid. If there is scholarship, then a financial aid is included as a tuition fee, as a per diem, as a living allowance or in any other shape, but there is always money included. In case of fellowship, though in most cases a financial aid will be provided, but the term does not necessarily suppose a financial aid. For example, if someone receives a scholarship to study at Ohio University or to do a research at NASA that means the person has for sure received money to study or to do a research. When MIT or Harvard announce scholarships for undergraduate, graduate or postgraduate students, for researchers or journalists, that always means the University or research institute or the foundation is going to fully or partly cover some of the costs. But the fellowship first of all is the status, only then a financial aid. Fellowship is a status within the University or research institute and it may or may not include a financial aid. Cambridge or Oxford sometimes announce a fellowship and only provide a desk with a computer at the library. For that particular position often apply many renowned researchers or public figures, who are ready to pay for all other costs themselves, only to receive the announced fellowship. Fellowship may be granted as a status within an academic institution and that’s it, nothing more, no salary (sometimes with salary), no financial aid, just status. With that status the person may be accepted as a fellow of certain college or department and have access to some of library and research facilities. Other differences between scholarships and fellowshipsScholarships are available from the very early stage of academic career. Even before University career and undergraduate studies one may apply for a scholarship in the school, but no fellowships are available for that stage. The same is true for undergraduate studies. All financial aid available for undergraduate students in the University is called scholarship and only in rare cases, when related to research activities it may be called fellowship. From graduate level financial aid, which is called a fellowship may be available for students who are particularly interested in some specific research area. Scholarships are granted to student level and above, and the fellowships are mainly for experienced individuals to apply. For example, if you search google for scholarships for journalists you will mainly get results about financial aid to study in the University at any level, but if you search fellowships for journalists you will get first of all results about programs for experienced journalists to conduct some investigations and do some research. In many instances scholarship and fellowship are used interchangeably, cause some confusion, and sometime mean the same thing or something different. Hopefully this short introduction about the differences of scholarship and fellowship is helpful. Share your feedback on twitter, Instagram, or mail us at support@devskrate. com.

    "title": "How to check if your email associated accounts are breached",
    "body": "1993/05/14 - Have you ever imagined how many details get leaked online everyday and gets sold on the dark web. Did you know that, your details also might have been grabbed into the wrong hands. All we know are a very few breaches that are from the tech gaints like Google, Facebook, Adobe and a few more. Some of the security breached we know are::  Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  Google Plus data breach exposing 52. 5 million users.  Adobe Breach Impacted 38 Million Users. But there are so many breaches occuring here and there everyday. How to find if your email is exposed or not:: To find this, we have three three sources that can be trusted. 1. Google Password Manager 2. Firefox Monitor3. Have I Been Pwned? Google Password Manager: Google only checks the passwords saved in your Google account. For instance, if you have used Google Chrome to save the password for the Netflix website. Google can only check for a password breach only on the Netflix website. To use this feature, Open Google Chrome or any other browser. Then open Password Manager.  This page also lists all the saved passwords which you can review, change, and edit. Click on Check Passwords option at the top.  Click on Check Passwords again. This will show you password analysis, along with three options.  Whether any of your passwords have been compromised.  List of reused passwords that are the same across multiple accounts and hence have the risk of being exposed. Here’s how to create a unique password.  List of weak passwords, which are easy to guess and hence, greater chances of being hacked. So, create a strong password. Firefox Monitor: Firefox Monitor is an online service by Mozilla that tells you about data breaches related to your email address. This is accessible from any browser and there’s no need to sign-up. To check if your email address has been exposed, first you need to visit Firefox Monitor’s website. Then type in the email address and click on “Check for Breaches”.  If your Email ID is comparatively new, chances are you’re safe and not been exposed to any data breaches. However, if your email ID is old, you might find a similar result as I have. This means that my ID was exposed to seven data breaches since 2007. Have I Been Pwned?: Have I Been Pwned is a website developed by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft Regional Director after the largest ever single breach of customer accounts — Adobe. The primary purpose of this site is to serve the public. Data breaches are rampant and many people don’t appreciate the scale or frequency with which they occur. By aggregating the data here I hope that it not only helps victims learn of compromises of their accounts, but also highlights the severity of the risks of online attacks on today’s internet. To check whether your data is breached, firstly open Have I Been Pwned site. Then enter your email address.  Then the site will display how many and what are all the breaches your email address have been part of Closing Words: Like I said at the start, no data is safe. As all the three services tell you about the breach after the breach is over, your credentials are out in the open. However, you can always take care of a few things, like changing your password frequently, avoid using the same or similar passwords, creating strong passwords, and also, enabling two-step verification or using Official Account Authenticator Apps wherever supported.
