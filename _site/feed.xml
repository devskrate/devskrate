&lt;p&gt;Meta tags are the things which will do these things. 
The minimal way of creating the meta tags are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;UTF-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Tech news&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;keywords&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Devs, Krate, DevsKrate, Tech&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;author&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Puneeth&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below are &lt;a href=&quot;https://ogp.me/&quot;&gt;Open Graph protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph(mainly used by social media).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Generating Preview Links&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:type&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;article&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:url&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://DevsKrate.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:image&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://DevsKrate.com/image.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:description&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;A tech website for developers, where you get everything about tech&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter uses open graph, but for gettings previews in the cards and to be more specific, twitter has it’s own meta tags. You can see how your preview works in twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&quot;&gt;“Twitter link preview”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:card&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;summary&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:site&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@DevsKrate&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:creator&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@puneeth&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:url&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://DevsKrate.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DevsKrate - Tech for everyone&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:description&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Your description here&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:image&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://DevsKrate.com/images/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;Why Visual Studio Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some Key Benefits of using VS Code -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Available on Mac, Linux, and Ofcourse Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit, Build, and Debug very easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highly configurable - &lt;strong&gt;Open-source project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as NodeJS, JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highly robust and Extensible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High availability of industry and community-developed extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Much loved dark theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;installing-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;Installing Visual Studio Code&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can download updated version of VS Code from their website - &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;https://code.visualstudio.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download from here  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/download&quot;&gt;https://code.visualstudio.com/download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;required-extensions-for-all-developers&quot;&gt;Required Extensions for all developers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Python extension by Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/python-editing.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Python editing&quot; height=&quot;350px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extension with rich support for the Python language, including features such as linting, debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I personally use &lt;strong&gt;black&lt;/strong&gt; code-formatter. we can configure it in our workspace settings in &lt;strong&gt;.vscode&lt;/strong&gt; file. This helps to maintain code and code-formatting consistent in development.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot the code formatting plugin in python
&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing&quot;&gt;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Java Extension by Mircosoft&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/java.png&quot; alt=&quot; Java &quot; height=&quot;60px&quot; width=&quot;60px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Java Extension Pack is a collection of popular extensions that can help write, test and debug Java applications in Visual Studio Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Markdown Renderer Extension&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/md-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;350px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Markdown Preview Enhanced is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities such as automatic scroll sync, math typesetting, mermaid, PlantUML, pandoc, PDF export, code chunk, presentation writer, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Prettier Extension for JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/prettier.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pretier&quot; height=&quot;80px&quot; width=&quot;80px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. ESLint&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/eslint.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;60px&quot; width=&quot;60px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will be useful to check JavaScript and TypeScript errors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn’t provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven’t installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install eslint&lt;/code&gt; in the workspace folder for a local install or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install -g eslint&lt;/code&gt; for a global install.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. CSS Peek&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/css.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS Peek is a great tool if you keep forgetting what was a CSS class was used for. However, that could also mean that your CSS class names are not meaningful, or you have written too much “unmaintainable” code. Still, this is sure going to be handy if you are viewing/rewriting someone else’s code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Debugger for Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/chrome.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debugger for Chrome is a great tool if you use a debugger in VSC. It allows you to launch an instance of Chrome navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Chrome. Using the URL parameter, you tell VSC which URL to either open or launch in Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Gitlens&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/git-lens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;60px&quot; width=&quot;37%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Git File History&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomber.git-file-history&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/git-file-history.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;350px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This helps to quickly browse the history (edits and commits done by you and others) in a cool and interesting visualization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can try this in browser also. you just need to do these three steps.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Go to a file in GitHub (or GitLab, or Bitbucket)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There’s no step three. you’ll love this.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Docker Extension&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/docker.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;350px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Docker extension makes it easier to build apps that leverage Docker containers. The extension helps scaffold needed files, build Docker images, debug your app inside a container, and an explorer that makes it easy to take actions on containers and images such as start, stop, inspect, remove, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. SQL Formatter&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradymholt.pgformatter&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/sql.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;60px&quot; width=&quot;60px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This VS Code extension formats PostgreSQL SQL, using the Perl based &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter&quot;&gt;pgFormatter&lt;/a&gt; tool. Supports keywords from SQL-92, SQL-99, SQL-2003, SQL-2008, SQL-2011 and PostgreSQL specifics keywords. Provides configuration to control formatting style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Path Intellisense&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense&quot;&gt;downlaod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vscode/path-intelli.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown gif&quot; height=&quot;350px&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Path Intellisense helps you include filenames or autocomplete them. This is a great tool if you want to type less for difficult filenames and make sure you always include the correct files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Booting problems like bootloop(Restarting when ubuntu is selected) or blank screen after selecting ubuntu in the grub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With My experience, I am giving here few fixes you may try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Uncheck the PPT security in BIOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly goto the BIOS (It depends on the system, for Dell press F12), then goto security, then goto PTT security and Uncheck it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Security -&amp;gt; PTT Security and uncheck PTT On
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click Apply (I would recommend choosing Save as Custom User Settings), then OK, then Exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should acctuallly work. If this does not work, try the second method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Boot from Advanced Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While booting from grub, you can see “Advanced Options for Ubuntu”. Select it and in that boot from the Old Kernel.
You may find many things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4-generic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4-generic (recovery mode)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu, with Linux 4.*-generic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu, with Linux 4.*-generic (recovery mode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boot with Linux 4.*-generic, don’t boot with recovery or any other options availabe additionally.
Now, you will boot into Ubuntu:).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, this method is not a permanent fix, you can use Ubuntu inthis way as long as you find the permanent fix, this will not do anything from accessing all the features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Info&lt;/strong&gt;: Why method 2 is not a permanent fix, because Ubuntu uses Linux kernel 5.4, so grub will boot from it by default. After booting in you can change the default kernel to boot, but be carefull while handling with the Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="ubuntu" /><category term="linux" /><category term="kernel" /><category term="intel" /><category term="os" /><summary type="html">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS has been released recently, after upgrading to it from ubuntu 18, 19, many had may faced booting problems(especially in DualBoot’s).

&lt;p&gt;In Kuo’s note, He said that due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, The Cupertino giant(Apple) had to do a lot of changes in its production, which lead to a one-month delay in engineering verification testing for the new iPhone 12 models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 12 lineup is expected to include four new models, and According to the analyst
the lower end models sized 6.1- inch and 5.4-inch iPhone will enter into the mass production in September
and the 6.7 inch which is expected to come with 5G support will enter not enter the production until October.
According to Kuo,this is because the 6.7-inch model has the most complicated design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above could mean that Apple will announce all the four iPhone models at once
but the release dates likely going to be different for each model due to the production delays.&lt;/p&gt;

It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus. Let’s see what Motorola has to offer 
in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moto-edge-plus&quot;&gt;Moto Edge Plus:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standout feature of this phone has to be its design, It’s 
an all-glass display with metal frame holding them together, The 
edges wrap around the edges with a punch hole at the top and in 
one word it looks gorgeous with two color variants to offer namely midnight 
megneta and solar black. Before 
taking a deep dive lets see the specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processor:	Qualcomm Snapdragon 865
Rear Camera	Triple Cameras 108MP(with OIS) + 16MP(Ultra Wide + Macro) + 8MP(3x Zoom with OIS)
front Camera	25MP
Display	        6.7 inches 90HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio: 21:9) FHD
5G support	both mm and sub-6 band.
Battery	        5000mAH(18W)
Fingerprint	In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)
Water Resistant	Water Resistant(IP 68)
Charging	Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 15W) + 5W(Reverse Wireless Charging)
RAM/ROM         12GB/128or256GB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;display-and-battery&quot;&gt;Display and battery:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display is a 6.7 inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the phone comes with a 90HZ refresh rate but the resolution is only FHD(1080p), which is a bummer at this price point but it helps increase the battery efficiency and in 
this phone moto has provided a huge 5000mAh battery and moto claims it can last till 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;camera&quot;&gt;Camera:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phone comes with a total of four cameras three at the back and one inside the punch hole. The primary sensor is a 108MP 
Samsung sensor which we saw in the galaxy s20 ultra, This camera by default shoots at 27MP and it has OIS built-in for stable video.The 
second sensory is an 8MP three times zoom sensor and this also has OIS for better video as well as zoom. The third is a 16MP Ultra wide sensor to capture ultra-wide shots.The selfie camera is a 25MP shooter. This phone has all the hardware required for a good camera it ultimately comes down to
camera software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-and-hardware&quot;&gt;Software and Hardware:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about software, It comes with an almost stock-like experience with a few added features based on android 10, and moto is calling it “My UX”.In days where flagship smartphones are removing the headphone jack moto has it in this phone which is a great thing.
The hardware also is top end with snapdragon 865, It also supports fast charging, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging 
and all other high-end features to compete against the top of galaxies and iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pricing&quot;&gt;Pricing:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phone is priced at 999.99 dollars which converts to around 75k price, which is very expensive considering what this phone has to offer.
If moto really wants to bring this phone to India it has to reduce the price to somewhere around 55k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moto-edge&quot;&gt;Moto Edge:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge is very similar to Edge plus with very few changes. The main shooter is 64MP instead of 108MP, the battery capacity is 4500mAH instead of 5000mAH, It 
only offers 4GB/6GB of RAM and it does not support any kind of wireless and reverse wireless charging on it but the key 
difference is that it comes with snapdragon 765 5G on board.This phone is priced at 699 EURO, which is 58,000 rupees. I think this phone is fairly overpriced and at this price we can get several other options
from vendors like one plus, Xiaomi, etc, which can offer us a flagship experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these phones are expected to launch in India after the pandemic has ended,what do you think about these phones&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="moto" /><category term="flagship" /><summary type="html">Moto after 4 years has come back to making flagship phones with its new edge series, It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus.

With this phone one plus is trying 
to tick all the boxes of a flagship. Did it succeed, let’s see in the article below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before taking a deep dive into the phones, let’s see what specs this phone has to offer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered dark&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Specifications&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Processor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 865&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rear Camera&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Quad Cameras 48MP(f/178) + 48MP(Ultra Wide) + 8MP(3x Zoom) + 5MP(Color Sensor)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;front Camera&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16MP&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Display&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6.78 inches 120HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio:19.8:9)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Connectivity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5G, WIFI 6 Support&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Battery&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4510mAH(30T warp charging)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fingerprint&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Water Resistant&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Water Resistant(IP 68)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Charging&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 30W) + 3W(Reverse Wireless Charging)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have carefully observed the specs, this phone includes an IP Rating as well as wireless charging.
This shows that one plus is not trying to cut corners against the best of samsung and apple but instead giving it all to take them head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phone pricing in India is not out yet but if we consider the US pricing which is 899$ 
converting it into INR we can estimate the price to be at around 68k with this price it 
still manages to undercut the iphone 11 and galaxy s20.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talking about the design, it has a single punch hole curved display similar to galaxy s10.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The highlight of this phone has to be its &lt;strong&gt;120Hz AMOLED&lt;/strong&gt; display which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display.(For people who are unaware of DisplayMate its like DXO Mark for Displays).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2020 oneplus 8 &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coming to the camera its a quad camera setup and on paper can take on the other flagships nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Build quality with its glass body attached together by a metal has always been good but this time it also added dust and water resistance which is rated as IP 68(fit enough to withstand dust, dirt and sand and are resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater for up to thirty minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-f-b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2020 oneplus 8 &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taking about battery life, this phone comes with a 4510mAH capacity which is fairly good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance is also great coming with snapdragon 865 processor.
This phone also supports 5G and WIFI 6 making it a future proof phone. The software thats the oxygen OS gives the cleanest andriod experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: One Plus ended up making a really appealing flagship smartphone undercutting the likes samsung and apple by a good margin and offering way more specifications at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="oneplus" /><category term="android" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">It has been 6 years since one plus has been making smartphones until last year the company has produced a lot of flagship killer but the company from the past year has changed its strategy to produce a true flagship with its one plus 7 pro and 7t pro they were good but lacked the bells and whistles that a true flagship from samsung and apple had. With this phone one plus is trying to tick all the boxes of a flagship. Did it succeed, let’s see in the article below.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-display.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-display.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">One Plus 8 - Flagship Killer or Wallet Killer</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/one-plus-8-spec/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One Plus 8 - Flagship Killer or Wallet Killer" /><published>2020-04-15T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-04-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/one-plus-8-spec</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/one-plus-8-spec/">&lt;p&gt;One Plus is now 6 years in smartphone making.Its strategy was always to launch a phone that brought with it a flagship experience but not so expensive as a flagship but as years passed by its pricing 
kept on increasing from generation to generation. So, is this new One plus 8 a “flagship killer or a wallet killer”, lets find out in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lets talk specs for a while, it’s powered by the top of the line Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, which comes with a 6.55 inches AMOLED with a 90HZ refresh rate, which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display.(For people who are unaware of display mate its like DXO Mark for Displays).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coming to the camera its a triple camera setup the main sensory and the wide angle are the same found on the one plus 7t which are 48MP and 16MP respectively and the third sensor is replaced by a macro lens to capture closeup shots. The selfie shooter is a 16MP sensor which is the same one found on the one plus 7t. The battery capacity is 4300 mAh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-f-b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2020 oneplus 8 &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phones pricing in India at this point of time is unknown but if we consider the price of 
this phone in US,We can expect a price at about 53,000 Rupees which is almost 13,000 price increase from the one plus 7t which was 37,999 rupees at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 13k price increase brings a new design change to the front which is punch hole display with curved edges(similar to the one found in the galaxy s10). The same old 90hZ display which is much brighter for better outdoor use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phones also comes with a slightly improved stereo speakers setup with dolby atmos support.The standout feature of this phone has to be the support for 5G and wifi 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that one plus, for this time has ended up making a wallet killer. If what you really want 5G we have much cheaper options from namely the realme X50 and if you want the smooth experience of oxygen OS. The older one plus phones namely the 7t can give you the same experience for much lesser price. One plus 8 is meant for people whose first priority is design, oxygen OS and 5G in a single package.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="oneplus" /><category term="android" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">One Plus is now 6 years in smartphone making.Its strategy was always to launch a phone that brought with it a flagship experience but not so expensive as a flagship but as years passed by its pricing kept on increasing from generation to generation.

&lt;strong&gt;[update ends]😊✌&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 March, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;
One week ago, President Donald Trump held a press conference wherein he claimed Google would be building a screening website for the coronavirus that would direct people to testing sites. As we learned in the following days, that wasn’t true. Google’s sister company Verily did launch such a site, but only for the Bay Area and reportedly it only offered tests to a very small number of people. Google, however, did say it would launch some sort of website and after a small delay, it’s here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the website and potentially more importantly, Google will start providing more enhanced information cards for people who search for terms related to the coronavirus. There will be information tabs for symptoms, prevention, global statics, and locally relevant information. It will look a bit like this:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google/COVID_19_MOBILE_SEARCH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;near by hospitals search result&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/covid19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;google.com/covid19&lt;/a&gt;. It does have useful resources, including a card that mimics what you see above. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-people-covid-19-information-and-resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s post announcing the site&lt;/a&gt; says that you will be able to find “state-based information, safety and prevention tips, search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators and businesses.” Google emphasizes that it’s pulling information from “authoritative” sources like the WHO and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only available in English right now, but a Google spokesperson tells The Verge that Spanish language support is soon to follow. The site was also designed with accessibility in mind, including with the larger fonts that Google usually uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website has videos in ASL, a global map showing confirmed cases by country, and plenty of information about Google’s other relief efforts — plus some feel-good YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through that description, however, you’ll notice that it doesn’t include what Trump originally claimed it would. The nearest thing to finding a test is a drop-down menu that provides links to local websites — for example, choosing California provides a link to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CDC has a “self-checker” chatbot&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft helped build, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/ih47JgriBzLY0nXEbncs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WSJ quoted an executive from a healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt; who put in a realistic context: “It’s just something consumers need now to help with anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, lots of big tech companies are making efforts to provide coronavirus-related support, but none of them are able to solve some of the biggest problems in the pandemic: access to testing and the impending crisis in our healthcare infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in the future, Google may actually provide a questionnaire and information about local drive-thru testing locations. But a spokesperson says that the company won’t do so until there’s authoritative and trustworthy information on those sites. That could be a long time coming, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="corona virus" /><category term="google" /><category term="outbreak" /><category term="general" /><summary type="html">Google had launched a new India specific Caronavirus site containing Health Information, Safety and precautions tips, Data &amp;amp; Insighs and Resources to help.

The company said it’s shutting down the app on May 12, as the project didn’t take off as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search giant first unveiled the app in May 2018 as a test in the Indian city of Mumbai to let you explore your neighborhood with help from local experts. Later in November, it expanded its base to a few more cities in the country. However, it failed to gain traction, likely because it simply didn’t have enough users to deliver an engaging experience. It never even came out of beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an email sent to customers, Google mentioned that the community answered over a million questions related to their localities, but the project didn’t grow the way the company had hoped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We launched Neighbourly as a Beta app to connect you with your neighbors and make sharing local information more human and helpful. As a community, you’ve come together to celebrate local festivals, shared crucial information during floods, and answered over a million questions.&lt;/i&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But Neighbourly hasn’t grown as we had hoped. In these difficult times, we believe that we can help more people by focusing on other Google apps that are already serving millions of people everyday.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google also pointed towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/localguides&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Maps Local Guide&lt;/a&gt; to help people in your region find answers related to the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes at an interesting time: &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus/#Community-Help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook just rolled out a ‘community help’ feature&lt;/a&gt; for people to request or offer assistance in their neighborhoods during the coronavirus crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is closing down on May 12; you’ll be able to download your Neighbourly content until October 12. Another one for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://killedbygoogle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
