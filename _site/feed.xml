&gt; There's nothing like NewBee(Noob) and Pro in Linux. It's an ocean of resources, Usage will completely depend on the work you do.

#### What is navi?

**Navi** is an interactive cheatsheet tool written in **Rust** for the **command-line and application launchers**. Just like Bro pages, Cheat, Tldr tools, Navi also provides a list of examples for a given command, skipping all other comprehensive text parts.

**Navi** allows you to browse through cheatsheets (that you may write yourself or download from maintainers) and execute commands, prompting for argument values.

from now you will never say any of these.
- How to run that command again?
- Oh, it's not in my bash history
- Damn, it's almost what I wanted but I need to change some args

See how cool navi is - 
![navi-demo]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mlogs/navi/navi-demo.gif)

- it will spare you from knowing CLIs by heart;
- it will teach you new one-liners.
- **Open Source tool**

It can be either used as a command or as a shell widget (Ctrl-R).

Xiaomi Announces MIUI 12, Here is a quick overview and list of phones which is expected to get this update.
Xiaomi in its recent keynote along with its phone announcement, it also the latest version of its software skin MIUI 12. It's a slight redesign of its exciting MIUI 11 and has quite a lot of visual changes. Let's see what features does this new UI brings to the table.

**1. UI changes**:
Xiaomi has been working hard to make their UI as refined and as minimal as possible. One of the UI changes comes in the notification shade, now we change some simple basic settings like wifi, Bluetooth in the notification shade itself with a tiny window and talking about looks, it looks much similar to control center found on the IOS.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-control-center.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The use of pictorial images to represent the status and data visualization ends up bringing a fresh look to the UI and the app animation(Opening and Closing) has also gotten much smoother.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-animation.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**2. Wallpapers**:
Wallpapers are one of the biggest visual changes and Xiaomi is calling them 'Super Wallpapers' and they look very cool, their live wallpapers which are based on high precision 3D models of
earth and mars and the fact that they turn into night scene when dark mode is added is a bounce. The live wallpapers feature for now is only exclusive to High-End Xiaomi phones.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-wallpapers.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**3. Dark Mode 2.0**:
You might ask me that we already have a system-wide dark theme in MIUI 11 so what's new in this, There are a good number of improvements in it. This time the company has worked to improve the readability to reduce eye strain and the text is now brighter and sharper. Dark mode also brings a new feature called 'Wallpaper Dimming' feature that will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper(It also supports this feature for custom wallpapers.)

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-dark-mode.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**4. MI Health App**:
Mi Health debuts in this new version of MIUI.This enables, The phone can track users steps, sleep, workouts, and other exercises but the fact that to enable the phone to do sleep tracking the phone should be in the same pillow is a bummer. 

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-health-app.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**5. Improved Gesture**:
This UI update also brings with it a slight improvement in the gestures. It now has a much lengthy bar at the bottom and much refined animations to go along with it.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-gestures.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**6. Privacy enhancement**:
Xiaomi this time along has followed a three-pronged approach to improve privacy in MIUI 12, namely Flare, Barbed Wire, and the Mask System.
**Firstly**, the flare will keep track of the app behavior of all apps on your phone and will present you the list of apps that may be violating the privacy policy or misusing permissions
and offer tips to avoid the above mishaps.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Flare privacy image&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-flare.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The **second** one is Barbed Wire, in which it offers several permission options similar to Android 10 and gives us options like for permanently allow or only when app is in use or allow only once and it even shows the icon of which app is using what services.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Barbed privacy image&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-barbed.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The **third** one is the Mask system which lets users to create and share virtual ID's when apps ask about the data, we saw a similar implementation in the Color OS 7 skin as well.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; alt=&quot;Mask&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-virtual-id.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**7. Floating window**:
Android 10 itself has the floating window feature, MI included  it to miui.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Floating window&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-floating-window.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**8. Ads**:
Talking about the Ad situation in MIUI only time has the answer.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Ads&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-ads.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**9. AI :**
AI feature is only available to china at present.

These are some of the important features coming to Xiaomi devices through MIUI 12 update.

Meta tags are the things which will do these things. 
The minimal way of creating the meta tags are
``` html
&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Tech news&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;Devs, Krate, DevsKrate, Tech&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Puneeth&quot;&gt;
```

The below are [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/), which enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph(mainly used by social media).
``` html
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;Generating Preview Links&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;article&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;https://DevsKrate.com&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;http://DevsKrate.com/image.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;A tech website for developers, where you get everything about tech&quot; /&gt; 
```

Twitter uses open graph, but for gettings previews in the cards and to be more specific, twitter has it's own meta tags. You can see how your preview works in twitter at [&quot;Twitter link preview&quot;](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

### Why Visual Studio Code 
Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

Here are some Key Benefits of using VS Code - 
* Available on Mac, Linux, and Ofcourse Windows.
* Edit, Build, and Debug very easily.
* Highly configurable - **Open-source project** 
* VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as NodeJS, JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.
* Highly robust and Extensible.
* High availability of industry and community-developed extensions.
* Much loved dark theme

##### Installing Visual Studio Code
We can download updated version of VS Code from their website - [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Booting problems like bootloop(Restarting when ubuntu is selected) or blank screen after selecting ubuntu in the grub.

With My experience, I am giving here few fixes you may try.

**1. Uncheck the PPT security in BIOS**

Firstly goto the BIOS (It depends on the system, for Dell press F12), then goto security, then goto PTT security and Uncheck it.
```
Security -&gt; PTT Security and uncheck PTT On
```
Click Apply (I would recommend choosing Save as Custom User Settings), then OK, then Exit.

This should acctuallly work. If this does not work, try the second method.

**2. Boot from Advanced Options**

While booting from grub, you can see &quot;Advanced Options for Ubuntu&quot;. Select it and in that boot from the Old Kernel.
You may find many things like 
- Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4-generic
- Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4-generic (recovery mode)
- Ubuntu, with Linux 4.*-generic
- Ubuntu, with Linux 4.*-generic (recovery mode)

Boot with Linux 4.*-generic, don't boot with recovery or any other options availabe additionally.
Now, you will boot into Ubuntu:).

Remember, this method is not a permanent fix, you can use Ubuntu inthis way as long as you find the permanent fix, this will not do anything from accessing all the features.

**Additional Info**: Why method 2 is not a permanent fix, because Ubuntu uses Linux kernel 5.4, so grub will boot from it by default. After booting in you can change the default kernel to boot, but be carefull while handling with the Kernel.</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="ubuntu" /><category term="linux" /><category term="kernel" /><category term="intel" /><category term="os" /><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS has been released recently, after upgrading to it from ubuntu 18, 19, many had may faced booting problems(especially in DualBoot’s).

It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus. Let's see what Motorola has to offer 
in this article.

# Moto Edge Plus:
The standout feature of this phone has to be its design, It's 
an all-glass display with metal frame holding them together, The 
edges wrap around the edges with a punch hole at the top and in 
one word it looks gorgeous with two color variants to offer namely midnight 
megneta and solar black. Before 
taking a deep dive lets see the specs.

Processor:	Qualcomm Snapdragon 865
Rear Camera	Triple Cameras 108MP(with OIS) + 16MP(Ultra Wide + Macro) + 8MP(3x Zoom with OIS)
front Camera	25MP
Display	        6.7 inches 90HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio: 21:9) FHD
5G support	both mm and sub-6 band.
Battery	        5000mAH(18W)
Fingerprint	In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)
Water Resistant	Water Resistant(IP 68)
Charging	Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 15W) + 5W(Reverse Wireless Charging)
RAM/ROM         12GB/128or256GB

# Display and battery:  
The display is a 6.7 inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the phone comes with a 90HZ refresh rate but the resolution is only FHD(1080p), which is a bummer at this price point but it helps increase the battery efficiency and in 
this phone moto has provided a huge 5000mAh battery and moto claims it can last till 2 days.

# Camera:
This phone comes with a total of four cameras three at the back and one inside the punch hole. The primary sensor is a 108MP 
Samsung sensor which we saw in the galaxy s20 ultra, This camera by default shoots at 27MP and it has OIS built-in for stable video.The 
second sensory is an 8MP three times zoom sensor and this also has OIS for better video as well as zoom. The third is a 16MP Ultra wide sensor to capture ultra-wide shots.The selfie camera is a 25MP shooter. This phone has all the hardware required for a good camera it ultimately comes down to
camera software.

# Software and Hardware:
Talking about software, It comes with an almost stock-like experience with a few added features based on android 10, and moto is calling it &quot;My UX&quot;.In days where flagship smartphones are removing the headphone jack moto has it in this phone which is a great thing.
The hardware also is top end with snapdragon 865, It also supports fast charging, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging 
and all other high-end features to compete against the top of galaxies and iPhones.

# Pricing:
This phone is priced at 999.99 dollars which converts to around 75k price, which is very expensive considering what this phone has to offer.
If moto really wants to bring this phone to India it has to reduce the price to somewhere around 55k. 

# Moto Edge:
Edge is very similar to Edge plus with very few changes. The main shooter is 64MP instead of 108MP, the battery capacity is 4500mAH instead of 5000mAH, It 
only offers 4GB/6GB of RAM and it does not support any kind of wireless and reverse wireless charging on it but the key 
difference is that it comes with snapdragon 765 5G on board.This phone is priced at 699 EURO, which is 58,000 rupees. I think this phone is fairly overpriced and at this price we can get several other options
from vendors like one plus, Xiaomi, etc, which can offer us a flagship experience.    

Both these phones are expected to launch in India after the pandemic has ended,what do you think about these phones</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="moto" /><category term="flagship" /><summary type="html">Moto after 4 years has come back to making flagship phones with its new edge series, It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus.
