Ofcourse YES... I know. Here are the cool websites to visit when you feel bored on internet.  
#### 1. FREESOUND  
FreeSound is the largest database of sound tracks that are available for free and when I say largest, I mean it.. So, There are tons of paid sites, that sell sound tracks. But if you ever need one, then go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://freesound.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freesound.org&lt;/a&gt;. You can find anything for a Bleep sound to a audio of someone flushing a toilet.

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/freesound.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FreeSound&quot; title=&quot;FreeSound&quot;&gt;

#### 2. NAPFLIX  
Unlike Netflix, which keep you awake at nights. &lt;a href=&quot;http://napflix.tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Napflix&lt;/a&gt; will help you fall asleep. It shows you hours of boring videos, which will calm you down And probably help you to sleep faster.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/napflix.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NapFlix&quot; title=&quot;NapFlix&quot;&gt;

#### 3. webkay - What every Browser knows about you  
This website tells you what your browser know about you, and all the website can access these data without asking your permission. Like your approx Location, your OS and the browser, what computer are you using, what social media are you logged in and a lot of other private stuff.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/webkay.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;webkay&quot; title=&quot;webkay&quot;&gt;

But what I really want to point out here is that The online sites also track your battery percentage not just in desktop, but also on mobile. So, imagine, you want to book an uber with less than 5% battery juice. Well, then then technically, it’s possible for the company to increase price just for you. Not saying this would happen, but technically it’s possible.  

Visit webkay &lt;a href=&quot;http://webkay.robinlinus.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

#### 4. Super Log Out  
Well, talking about the browser, try out super log. It’s a simple app that automatically log you out of all the sign in account on your browser with just one click.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/superlogout.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Super Log Out&quot; title=&quot;Super Log Out&quot;&gt;

When you are using a public or friends computer though, don’t click on the link Unless you really want to use this service.  

Visit Super Log Out &lt;a href=&quot;http://superlogout.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color:red; background-color:#D3D3D3;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Caution: Dont Visit, unless you require it!!!&lt;/span&gt;  
#### 5. Button Bass  
This website plays a EDM loop when you tap a cube and if you are good with this, you can make your own music.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/buttonbass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Button Bass&quot; title=&quot;Button Bass&quot;&gt;

And that’s not all, There are several other genre like dubstep, electronic and yes, there are android apps for that as well. Though, there is no option to record the audio. So, you’ll have to use sound sought of workaround.   

Visit Button Bass &lt;a href=&quot;http://buttonbass.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;    


#### 6. Radio Garden  
Now, let me tell you a secret, back then in 1980, we used to have a big radio in our house. It’s quite wonderful, how quickly technology change. So, anyways, Radio garden is music website that let you listen to 8000 live radio station from all around the world. It’s a great way to discover new songs from different language.  
Visit Radio Garden &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.garden/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

Usually we do see some cool visualizations with great look and feel. But this is an out of box JavaScript Library which helps you to plot graphs as hand-drawn charts.

##### What is RoughViz.js?
**roughViz.js** is a reusable **JavaScript** library for creating sketchy/hand-drawn styled charts in the browser, based on [D3.js v5](https://d3js.org/), [roughjs](https://roughjs.com/), and [handy](http://handyjs.org/).

See some basic examples here - 
![roughviz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwilber/random_data/master/roughViz.gif)

##### Why RoughViz.js?
Use these charts where the communication goal is to show intent or generality, and not absolute precision. Or just because they're fun and look weird. In our view those which will look weird will get more attention first than the best one. If you can create content which looks like hand-drawn images, sure you'll get appreciation.

Until now, if your organization wanted to use GitHub for private development, you had to subscribe to one of our paid plans.
But every developer on earth should have access to GitHub. They told that **Price shouldn’t be a barrier.**

This means teams can now manage their work together in one place: CI/CD, project management, code review, packages, and more.
Github allows everyone to be able to ship great software on the platform developers love.

Teams who need advanced features (like code owners), enterprise features (like SAML), or personalized support can upgrade to one of our paid plans.

Github is also reducing the price of paid Team plan from **$9 per user/month to $4 per user/month**, effective immediately.
Existing customers will have their bills automatically reduced going forward.

Poco, In February launched its new mid-ranger the Poco x2 which is a rebranded K30. As people say &quot;History tends to repeat itself&quot;, a somewhat similar thing has happened the Poco F2 pro is a rebranded Redmi K30 pro.
What does the phone bring with it lets find out in this article?

**Key Specs**:

{:class=&quot;table table-bordered dark&quot;}
|Name            | Specifications                                                            |

|Charging        | Type-C cable, with Fast charging                                          |

**Design and Build Quality**:
The massive notch of the F1 is replaced by a fullscreen bezel-less experience on the front and
has an in-display fingerprint sensor on the front as well. The rear panel has a circular camera array and Poco branding, which is beautiful to look at. Both the front and back are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5.

**Display**:
This phone now comes with a glass sandwitch design put together by an aluminum frame, which is way superior compared to the polycarbonate build its predecessor(Poco F1) comes with. This phone comes with a 6.67-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. We are disappointed to see a 60Hz display in 2020 but at least it comes with 180Hz touch sampling rate and a peak brightness close to 1200nits. This display also brings with it support for HDR 10+. We can also set different color types like Enhanced, Original, P3, sRGB.

  &lt;img width=&quot;75%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/poco/pocof2-pro-display.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**Camera**:
The F2 Pro comes with a quad-camera array in the circular cutout on the rear. The primary sensor is the 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor, along with a 13MP (f/2.4) ultra-wide-angle lens with 123-degree FOV, a 5MP telephoto macro camera and a 2MP depth sensor. The phone also supports 8k video capture. On the selfie side of things it comes with a 20MP pop-up camera with support for slow-motion video and other cool features. We think the pop-up cameras are not the one everyone liked.

We think that the phone is overpriced for what it brings on board with it. We are really hoping for real poco series not the rebranded versions of redmi series. We really enjoyed poco F1 and we want the fire of POCO in it's successors also.upto MIUI 14</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="poco" /><category term="redmi" /><category term="mi" /><category term="smartphones" /><summary type="html">Redmi K30 Pro has been rebranded to poco and launched it as POCO F2 Pro; Price Starting at €499</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/mi/poco/pocof2_pro_feature.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/mi/poco/pocof2_pro_feature.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI-generated memes can compete with Human-generated memes</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/AI-generated-memes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI-generated memes can compete with Human-generated memes" /><published>2020-05-12T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/AI-generated-memes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/AI-generated-memes/">&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a good chunk of my workday so far creating AI-generated memes in seconds with just simple clicks. Usually I do make memes when I’m free but after knowing that I can generate memes using AI, I started testing the algorithm and results as pretty cool. Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgflip.com/ai-meme&quot;&gt;ImgFlip’s&lt;/a&gt; Ai based meme generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;why-this-is-interesting&quot;&gt;Why this is interesting?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a glance, it looks like your random collection of meme templates. But those memes aren’t &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;, I mean not at all generated by humans. They are being created at that instance of time by an artificial intelligence (AI) ALgorithm that can understand meme creation technique and can generate some cool memes. You can directly ask for generating a meme with random template or else you can select a template out of 40 viral meme templates to generate a meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mlogs/AI/imgFlip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ImgFlip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These captions are generated by a deep artificial neural network. Nothing about the text generation is hardcoded, except that the maximum text length is limited for sanity. The model uses character-level prediction, so you can specify prefix text of one or more characters to influence the text generated. Using someone’s name or other short text as a prefix works best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network was trained using public images generated by users of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgflip.com/memegenerator&quot;&gt;Imgflip Meme Generator&lt;/a&gt; for the top 48 most popular Meme Templates. Beware, no profanity filtering was done on the training data so you may encounter vulgarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, Imgflip’s neural network processed a lot of memes and then tried to predict what memes should look like. The results are often hilarious, and they certainly feel like real memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are collection of some crazy memes generated there.&lt;/p&gt;

**How would it be if there's a robust develop environment embedded in GitHub itself?**. Very soon Github will bring you the [Visual Studio Code](https://devskrate.com/configure-vscode-like-a-pro/) Development experience right in your GitHub within browser itself.

In order to configure your Github to make your work more productive add these extensions to your [browser](https://devskrate.com/best-extensions-for-github-part-1/).

Let's discuss why CodeSpaces will be much loved by developers..

#### What is CodeSpaces?

In a major announcement for developers, GitHub has launched CodeSpaces — a feature that lets you code directly on the web. It's like a virtual Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on the cloud.

&gt; Codespaces can be configured to load your code and dependencies, developer tools, extensions, and dotfiles. Switching between environments is simple—you can navigate away at any time, and when you switch back, your codespace is automatically reopened.

#### Why Codespaces?

As the title says Codespaces is Your instant Dev Environment. you'll get the full Visual Studio Code experience without leaving GitHub. 

Till now, to contribute to a project you would need to clone the repository, and set up the environment on your local machine according to the requirements of a project. This is the toughest part we've ever felt.
But with Codespaces, you don’t need to do this anymore. Just with a single click Github will setup the whole environment within seconds.

###### 2. Simplify your workflow

You can automatically set up dependencies and SSH keys. Go from code to commit faster on any project. This is one of the main advantage CodeSpaces will have.

###### 3. Extend and customize

As we said earlier Codespaces is your Visual Studio Code experience. you can install all the best [vscode extensions](https://devskrate.com/configure-vscode-like-a-pro/)

The idea is to save time that would have otherwise been wasted typing phrases, sentences or entire paragraphs.

Espanso is an open source text template program for Windows, Mac and Linux that helps users save time.

During the installation, you have the choice to add Espanso to &quot;PATH&quot; (Windows System Variable) and to enable it to auto-start with Windows. You will also need to restart the computer to get the program working. properly; I think it requires the restart to enable the &quot;PATH&quot; correctly. Start the program and you should see an icon on the system tray. Right-clicking on it allows you to disable it or exit the program.

Espanso works in all applications including Notepad, Word, Firefox, Thunderbird, and more.

## Matches
Espanso uses the concept of Matches (keyword recognition) i.e., when you type a word that's present in the program's settings, it triggers the application to substitute the keyword with its configured replacement. The official wiki explains the technical details rather well, but I'll demonstrate how it works below for your convenience.

Fire up a text editor or browser, or any other program that accepts text input. Type the word :espanso and it will magically be replaced with the phrase &quot;Hi there!&quot;. In this case &quot;:espanso&quot; is the keyword and &quot;Hi There&quot; is the replaced text.

If you haven't guessed it already, Espanso is the Italian word for Expanded.

So, how do we customize Espanso?
Go to the application's &quot;Roaming&quot; folder in your User directory.

This folder contains a &quot;default.yml&quot; file. Open it using a text editor, e.g. Notepad works just fine. Espanso uses YAML syntax, which is very user-friendly. Look at the highlighted section in the screenshot below. That's the match trigger and replacement which I mentioned in my example.

## Rules
The indentation is necessary for the syntax to work. So if your match isn't being triggered correctly, check the spacing in the syntax. The other rule is to remember to use the : symbol. For e.g. :espanso vs espanso. The first one is correct, the latter won't trigger the program.

## How to add new words to Espanso?
Let's try adding a new one. Write a new trigger word and choose a replacement phrase. To make it easy, you can just copy the &quot;espanso&quot; trigger, paste it in a new line and edit it.
Save the document, exit Espanso and start it again. Now type :ghx and it should be replaced with gHacks.net. That's incredibly easy, isn't it? You can use it to add email signatures, URLs, HTML Tags, commonly used phrases, responses, etc, and save some time.

![Espanso Demo]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mlogs/espanso/espanso_yml.jpeg)

You can even replace a text with an image, the syntax is slightly different.

``` yml
- trigger: &quot;:word&quot;
image_path: &quot;/path/image.ext&quot;
```

Replace word with the keyword you want and the /path/image.ext with the full path of the image's location, followed by the name of the picture and its extension. This may not be practical in day-to-day usage, but the option is there, in case you want to use it.

Designed for business and education, Teams includes group chat, video calling and collaboration tools, and has seen a spike in usage since countries and states have started directing residents to stay and work from home when possible to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.

With the update to Microsoft's collaboration tool, you can now pick a custom image as your video chat background. The Zoom video chat service also lets you pick your own custom background images for calls. But with recent concerns about Zoom security, some users are starting to look to other services such as Teams for their chats.

## How to change your video chat background in Microsoft Teams

Important catch: This feature is only available for scheduled meetings, according to Microsoft. 

1. Start or or join a Teams meeting, from the Windows or Mac application (you can't change your background on the web app at this point). 

2. At the bottom of the screen, click or tap the three dots to go to your Meeting controls.

3. Select More actions &gt; Show background effects. Either select Blur to blur your background, or choose from the available images to replace it. 

4. You'll be able to preview your background to see how it looks. If you like it, hit Apply. That's it!

In the future, you'll also be able to create your own images, upload them to Teams, and then select them as a background image for your video chats, reports said.

You can have video chats with up to 250 people in Microsoft Teams, and if your workplace or school has access to Office 365, you already have access to it. You can also check out a free version of Microsoft's communication tool.</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="meetings" /><category term="lockdown" /><category term="video calls" /><summary type="html">You can finally add your own background to Microsoft Teams video chats.
