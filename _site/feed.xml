Did you know that, your details also might have been grabbed into the wrong hands.

All we know are a very few breaches that are from the tech gaints like Google, Facebook, Adobe and a few more.  

### Some of the security breached we know are:  
+ Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  
+ Google Plus data breach exposing 52.5 million users.  
+ Adobe Breach Impacted 38 Million Users.  

But there are so many breaches occuring here and there everyday.

## How to find if your email is exposed or not:

To find this, we have three three sources that can be trusted.

**1. Google Password Manager**    
**2. Firefox Monitor**  
**3. Have I Been Pwned?**  

### Google Password Manager  

Google only checks the passwords saved in your Google account. For instance, if you have used Google Chrome to save the password for the Netflix website. Google can only check for a password breach only on the Netflix website.

To use this feature, **Open Google Chrome or any other browser**. Then **open &lt;a href=&quot;https://passwords.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Password Manager&lt;/a&gt;**.  This page also lists all the saved passwords which you can review, change, and edit. **Click on Check Passwords option** at the top.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/security/google-password-check-click.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Password Manager&quot; title=&quot;Google Password Manager&quot; /&gt;

Click on Check Passwords again. This will show you password analysis, along with three options.

* Whether any of your passwords have been compromised.  
* List of reused passwords that are the same across multiple accounts and hence have the risk of being exposed. Here’s how to create a unique password.  
* List of weak passwords, which are easy to guess and hence, greater chances of being hacked. So, create a strong password.   

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/security/google-password-check.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Password Manager&quot; title=&quot;Google Password Manager&quot; /&gt;

### Firefox Monitor  

Firefox Monitor is an online service by Mozilla that tells you about data breaches related to your email address. This is accessible from any browser and there’s no need to sign-up. To check if your email address has been exposed, first you need to visit Firefox Monitor’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Then **type in the email address** and click on **“Check for Breaches”**.   

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/security/firefox-password-check-click.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox Monitor&quot; title=&quot;Firefox Monitor&quot; /&gt;

If your Email ID is comparatively new, chances are you’re safe and not been exposed to any data breaches. However, if your email ID is old, you might find a similar result as I have. This means that my ID was exposed to seven data breaches since 2007.  
&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/security/firefox-password-check.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox Monitor&quot; title=&quot;Firefox Monitor&quot; /&gt;


### Have I Been Pwned?

Have I Been Pwned is a website developed by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft Regional Director after the largest ever single breach of customer accounts — Adobe. 

The primary purpose of this site is to serve the public. Data breaches are rampant and many people don't appreciate the scale or frequency with which they occur. By aggregating the data here I hope that it not only helps victims learn of compromises of their accounts, but also highlights the severity of the risks of online attacks on today's internet.

To check whether your data is breached, firstly **open Have I Been Pwned &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;**. Then **enter your email address**.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/security/hibp-password-check-click.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Have I Been Pwned?&quot; title=&quot;Have I Been Pwned?&quot;&gt;

Then the site will display how many and what are all the breaches your email address have been part of 

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/security/hibp-password-check.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Have I Been Pwned?&quot; title=&quot;Have I Been Pwned?&quot;&gt;

## Closing Words  
Like I said at the start, no data is safe. As all the three services tell you about the breach after the breach is over, your credentials are out in the open. However, you can always take care of a few things, like changing your password frequently, avoid using the same or similar passwords, creating strong passwords, and also, enabling **two-step verification** or using Official **Account Authenticator Apps** wherever supported.</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="security" /><category term="breaches" /><category term="pwned" /><category term="hacked" /><summary type="html">Have you ever imagined how many details get leaked online everyday and gets sold on the dark web.

### Main difference between Scholarship and Fellowship

The most important difference between `scholarship` and `fellowship` is that the term `scholarship` always means that there is a **financial aid** available. So there is no `scholarship` without **financial aid**. If there is `scholarship`, then a **financial aid** is included as a **tuition fee**, as a **per diem**, as a **living allowance** or in any other shape, but there is always money included. In case of **fellowship**, though in most cases a **financial aid** will be provided, but the term does not necessarily suppose a **financial aid**.

For example, if someone receives a `scholarship` to study at Ohio University or to do a research at NASA that means the person has for sure received money to study or to do a research. When MIT or Harvard announce `scholarships` for undergraduate, graduate or postgraduate students, for researchers or journalists, that always means the University or research institute or the foundation is going to fully or partly cover some of the costs.

But the `fellowship` first of all is the status, only then a **financial aid**. `Fellowship` is a status within the University or research institute and it may or may not include a **financial aid**. Cambridge or Oxford sometimes announce a `fellowship` and only provide a desk with a computer at the library. For that particular position often apply many renowned researchers or public figures, who are ready to pay for all other costs themselves, only to receive the announced `fellowship`.

`Fellowship` may be granted as a status within an academic institution and that’s it, nothing more, no salary (sometimes with salary), no financial aid, just status. With that status the person may be accepted as a fellow of certain college or department and have access to some of library and research facilities.

### Other differences between scholarships and fellowships

`Scholarships` are available from the very early stage of academic career. Even before University career and undergraduate studies one may apply for a `scholarship` in the school, but no fellowships are available for that stage.

The same is true for undergraduate studies. All **financial aid** available for undergraduate students in the University is called `scholarship` and only in rare cases, when related to research activities it may be called `fellowship`.

 

From graduate level **financial aid**, which is called a `fellowship` may be available for students who are particularly interested in some specific research area.

 

`Scholarships` are granted to student level and above, and the `fellowships` are mainly for experienced individuals to apply. For example, if you search google for **scholarships for journalists** you will mainly get results about **financial aid** to study in the University at any level, but if you search **fellowships for journalists** you will get first of all results about programs for experienced journalists to conduct some investigations and do some research.

 

In many instances scholarship and fellowship are used interchangeably, cause some confusion, and sometime mean the same thing or something different. Hopefully this short introduction about the differences of scholarship and fellowship is helpful.

**1.** First clone the SDK from
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**2.** Now, extract it in the desired location(preferred 'home' directory) by either right clicking and extract or by 
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;tar xf flutter_linux_v1.12.13+hotfix.8-stable.tar.xz&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; tar xf flutter_linux_v1.12.13+hotfix.8-stable.tar.xz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**3.** Now add flutter to your PATH
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text='export PATH=&quot;$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin&quot;' data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; export PATH=&quot;$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**4.** The last step is running
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;flutter doctor&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; flutter doctor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This command checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window. The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter; it is not necessary to install Dart separately. Check the output carefully for other software you might need to install or further tasks to perform (shown in bold text).

**Note: Android studio is mandatory for running Flutter**

##### After this many people may face issues with android studio. For example like this
```
[-] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    • Android SDK at /Users/obiwan/Library/Android/sdk
    ✗ Android SDK is missing command line tools; download from https://goo.gl/XxQghQ
    • Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,
      visit https://flutter.dev/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
```

#### To, resolve these issues even after installing Android studio, follow the below steps

**1.** Open android studio and then goto settings and then Android SDK.

![Android-studio-settings-sdk]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/flutter-install-1.png)

**2.** Now UNCHECK the &quot;Hide Obsolete packages&quot; and then verify all the below mentioned are installed.
+ Android SDK Build-Tools
+ Android SDK Command-line Tools
+ Android SDK Platform-Tools
+ Android SDK Tools(Obsolete) [This is generally hidden until you uncheck the Hide Obsolete Packages]

![Android-SDK-Tools(Obsolete)-Install]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/android/flutter-install-2.png)

Install(Tick all the above and click apply, wait until download and installation of the above packages) the above packages.

Then, goto Terminal and run
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;flutter doctor&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; flutter doctor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By this time it should work. If it is not working close and open the terminal and set the PATH and try again.</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="os" /><category term="linux" /><category term="windows" /><category term="student" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">Get the Flutter SDK</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/flutter.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/flutter.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Xiaomi’s MI Laptop’s Finally Coming To India</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/xiaomi-laptops-mi-notebooks-india/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Xiaomi’s MI Laptop's Finally Coming To India" /><published>2020-05-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/xiaomi-laptops-mi-notebooks-india</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/xiaomi-laptops-mi-notebooks-india/">In China, Xiaomi has disrupted the laptop market in 2016 with the introduction of the Mi Notebook, It was such a good value for money product, **most reviewers ended calling it a steal**.

This smart tv comes in two sizes the 32 and the 43-inch. The main differentiator apart from size is that the 32 inch comes with an HD screen whereas the 43-inch comes with a full HD, while the rest of the specifications remain the same.


#### Display:
Realme's tv as mentioned above comes in at two sizes namely the 32 and the 43 inch. These **LED Back-Light displays** comes with chroma boost picture engine to enhance the overall picture quality and improve the brightness, color, contrast, and clarity to deliver stunning visuals. The TV supports up to 400 nits of brightness and up to 178-degree viewing angles. It also has support HDR 10 and HLG and it offers seven display modes starting from standard, sport, movie, user, energy-saving, game to vivid mode for more customized picture quality.

![RealmeTV Display]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/2020-realmetv-display.png)

#### Design:
The stand-out feature of this Tv has to be its design. It comes an almost bezel-less design, which Realme is calling **Premium Bezel-less Design**. The size of the bezel is as thin as 8.7mm on the top and around the sides, but the bottom bezel is a bit thicker and it houses the realme logo. You can either prop up the TV or wall-mount it, that's entirely up to your choice.

![RealmeTV Design]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/realmetv-design.jpg)

#### Software:
This smart TV comes with **Andriod TV 9.0**, which is Google’s latest OS for television sets. There are no additional skins on top and that's a good thing. It comes with Youtube, Prime Video, Netflix, and Live TV pre-installed. You can also download more apps and games from the play store. It also comes with chrome-cast built-in,to syn content of your phone with the TV. Since it is an android TV, It also comes with google assistant of hands-free voice commands.

![RealmeTV Android TV 9.0]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/realmeTV-software.jpg)

#### Internals:
Powering this TV is the quad-core 64-bit MediaTek chipset (featuring ARM Cortex A53 CPU, clocked at up to 1.1GHz) and Mali-470 MP3 GPU. It comes with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of ROM. The TV comes with a 24W quad-speaker(2 speakers and 2 tweeters) with Dolby Audio support for rich sound stage.

#### Ports and Connectivity:
Speaking about connectivity it comes with 2.4GHZ WIFI, Bluetooth 5.0, and more. The fact that this does not come with WIFI 5 standard is a bit of a letdown.

![RealmeTV Ports]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/realmeTV-ports.jpg)

This TV  comes with a decent port selection, 3x HDMI, 2x USB, 1x Ethernet, 1x SPDIF, 1x AV port, 1x antenna in port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. 

#### Realme Smart TV: Remote
The remote looks similar to another smart remote from XIAOMI and ONE PLUS. It comes with a power On/Off button, a mute button, a Circular button for navigation at the top.below the circular button is the back, home, and settings button. Below them are the quick buttons for Netflix, YouTube, and Prime Video. It also comes with assistant button for quick voice commands and a plus, minus buttons to the left and right side of it, to increase and decrease volume. It can be operated both via the infrared and Bluetooth.

#### Price and Availability:
The 32-inch Realme Smart TV is priced at Rs. 12,999 whereas the 43-inch variant is priced at Rs. 21,999 for the larger screen and higher resolution. These smart TVs will go on sale starting from 2nd June on Flipkart and Realme’s website.</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="Realme" /><category term="SmartTV" /><category term="AndroidTv" /><summary type="html">Realme, famously known for its smartphones, has started expanding its portfolio, and this time its the new Realme Smart Tv.

Millions of developers rely on GitHub for software development to make it more fun and collaborative.
The tool `gh` brings the [GitHub](https://github.com/) experience right to your terminal.


#### Installation 
You can install GitHub CLI today on most of the Operating Systems available -
- macOS     
- Windows     
- Linux     

Install this from [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation-and-upgrading)

It’s available today for GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud, but not yet available for GitHub Enterprise Server. This will have support support for Enterprise Server when it’s out of beta.

#### How to use?
`gh` currently suppports with `issues` and `pull requests` because many developers use them every day. Here are few examples provided by GitHub on how `gh` can improve your experience when contributing to an open source project.

- #####  Filter lists to your needs
    Find an open source project you want to contribute to and clone the repository. And then, to see where maintainers want community contributions, use `gh` to **filter the issues** to only show those with `help-wanted` labels.

    ![gh-example1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli1.png)

- #####  Quickly view the details
    Find an **issue** describing a bug that seems like something you can fix, and use `gh` to quickly open it in the browser to get all the details you need to get started. 
         
    ![gh-example2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli2.png)

- #####  Create a pull request
    Create a **branch**, make several commits to fix the bug described in the issue, and use `gh` to create a *pull request* to share your contribution. By using GitHub CLI to create *pull requests*, it also automatically creates a fork when you don’t already have one, and it pushes your branch and creates your *pull request* to get your change merged

    ![gh-example3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli3.png)

- #####  View the status of your work
    Get a quick snapshot the next morning of what happened since you created your *pull request*. `gh` shows the review and check **status** of your *pull requests*

    ![gh-example4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli4.png)

- #####  Easily check out pull requests
    One of the maintainers reviewed your *pull request* and requested changes. You probably switched branches since then, so use `gh` to checkout the *pull request* branch. We never remember the right commands either! Make the changes, push them, and soon enough the pull request is merged—congratulations!

How this competes with node.js?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/deno-js-altenative-to-node-js/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is Deno.js? How this competes with node.js?" /><published>2020-05-24T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-24T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/deno-js-altenative-to-node-js</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/deno-js-altenative-to-node-js/">Deno is the creation of Ryan Dahl, which is a new JavaScript runtime for the backend, but instead of being written in C++, it’s written in Rust, based on the Tokio platform (which provides the asynchronous runtime needed by JavaScript), running on Google’s V8 engine. It is also a new runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser. 


#### Why should we use this?   

Generally we may get a doubt, why should I use it, here are some of it's features. They are:

##### 1. Security is integrated

Node.js allows you to access read and write into the filesystem, access environment variables, make outgoing requests, etc. As well as it also opens up a security risk if you are not careful when writing code.

So instead, Deno uses command-line arguments to enable or disable access to different security features. So if you need your script to be able to access the /etc folder, you can do:
 
```sh
deno --allow-read=/etc myscript.ts
```
It will allow your code to read from the folder, anything else and you’ll get a security exception. This is similar to how other platforms handle security. 

##### 2. Complete standard library

Deno claims to have a complete standard library allowing developers to use official tools to perform basic tasks and only requiring the use of external libraries for complex tasks and it comes with the tools to add color to terminal text, generate UUIDs, work with external data structures,  and for writing WebSockets.

##### 3. Integrated Typescript

In Deno, by default the integration into JavaScript is done internally, so no need for external tooling. By default Deno takes care of a lot, you can overwrite the configuration by using your own tsconfig.json file:

```sh
deno run -c tsconfig.json [your-script.ts]
```
The default configuration of Deno is to use strict mode, so any ill-advised coding practice will be alerted immediately.


#### Deno Installation

Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below: 

##### Using Shell (macOS, Linux):
```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```
##### Using PowerShell (Windows):
```sh
$ iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
##### Using Cargo (Windows, macOS, Linux):
```sh
$ cargo install deno
```
##### Using Homebrew (macOS):
```sh
$ brew install deno
```
##### Using Chocolatey (Windows):
```sh
$ choco install deno
```
##### Using Scoop (Windows):
```sh
$ scoop install deno
```

Back then, Slack began as an internal tool for Stewart Butterfield's company Tiny Speck during the development of Glitch, an online game. Then Slack was launched in August 2013.

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/slack-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Slack&quot; title=&quot;Slack&quot; /&gt;   

In 2016, Satya Nadella and Bill Gates met up to discuss an important matter. They wanted to bid 8 billion USD to acquire Slack, the SaaS giant that dominated the team chat app space. The meeting had a surprising conclusion: instead of buying Slack, they decided to build their own team chat app tool. In November 2016, Microsoft Teams was officially launched.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/teams-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Teams&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft Teams&quot; /&gt;  

And now, both Teams and Slack had gained a good amount of daily active users.  

#### Choosing between Slack and Microsoft Teams for your next collaboration tool? Here’s what you need to know about the differences between the two, so you can choose the platform that best suits the needs of your team.  

Talking about features, there is a large difference in both of then. They're

### Microsoft Teams integrations vs Slack integrations  

 Microsoft Teams and Slack take slightly different approaches to integration with other apps.  

#### Slack integrations  
Slack boasts a ton of integrations with a variety of different apps—more than 800 for paid plans, to be exact.  
&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/slack-integrations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slack Integrations&quot; title=&quot;Slack Integrations&quot; /&gt;   
The sheer number and variety of apps available means that you can customize your Slack workspace to make your workflow seamless.  

#### Microsoft Teams integrations  

While Slack offers more options for customization, Microsoft Teams takes a different approach—offering a full-fledged collaboration platform with many different functionalities built in from day one.  

Essentially, Teams isn't meant to be a standalone tool. It's a fully integrated Office 365 collaboration hub, allowing users to move seamlessly between tasks and apps within the Teams window.

### Wrapping up  

Here are some of our conclusions regarding Slack vs. Microsoft Teams.  

**Pricing:** Both Teams and Slack have freemium plans. When it comes to the paid plans, the cheapest Microsoft Teams plan is less expensive than Slack’s cheapest plan. MT wins this roound.  

**Layout and design:** The layout in Microsoft Teams has far too many tabs. On the other hand, there is less to see immediately in Slack because they want to improve their user interface. Moreover, Slack has more options to customize the app’s look.  

**Messaging:** Both Teams and Slack have different ways to send and receive messages, including threads. Microsoft Teams has more built-in options to format your text, and in return, Slack lets you set reminders for individual messages.  

**File sharing and collaboration:** Microsoft Teams lets you share Office files and work on them immediately from the workspace. Slack doesn’t come with the option of editing documents from the workspace, so you have to download files and open them in specific apps to edit them.  

**Video calls:** Both apps allow video calls and the feature works very well. However, Teams has a built-in video recording feature, which is really neat. Moreover, MT allows up to 250 people in a single call when you’re on a paid plan, compared to Slack which allows 15 people at a time.  

**Integrations:** While Microsoft Teams has excellent native integrations with Office and some third-party app integrations, Slack definitely wins in this department – it has more than 800 integrations that you can use.  

**Summary:** Both apps are a good choice but they are catered for different needs. If you want lots of third-party integrations and the ability to customize your app to a great extent go with **Slack**.

On the other hand, **Microsoft Teams** works really well for companies that do a lot of work Office 365 and who already pay for that service.  

If you are planning to use free version, then Microsoft Teams would suit you the best because, there are are a lot more features in Microsoft Teams than Slack. May be this is the reason why, Microsoft Teams had a larger user base.</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="microsoft teams" /><category term="communication" /><category term="trends" /><category term="comparsion" /><summary type="html">Both Microsoft Teams and Slack are collaboration platform tools that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/internet/slack-vs-teams.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/internet/slack-vs-teams.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
