Designed for business and education, Teams includes group chat, video calling and collaboration tools, and has seen a spike in usage since countries and states have started directing residents to stay and work from home when possible to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.

With the update to Microsoft's collaboration tool, you can now pick a custom image as your video chat background. The Zoom video chat service also lets you pick your own custom background images for calls. But with recent concerns about Zoom security, some users are starting to look to other services such as Teams for their chats.

## How to change your video chat background in Microsoft Teams

Important catch: This feature is only available for scheduled meetings, according to Microsoft. 

1. Start or or join a Teams meeting, from the Windows or Mac application (you can't change your background on the web app at this point). 

2. At the bottom of the screen, click or tap the three dots to go to your Meeting controls.

3. Select More actions &gt; Show background effects. Either select Blur to blur your background, or choose from the available images to replace it. 

4. You'll be able to preview your background to see how it looks. If you like it, hit Apply. That's it!

In the future, you'll also be able to create your own images, upload them to Teams, and then select them as a background image for your video chats, reports said.

You can have video chats with up to 250 people in Microsoft Teams, and if your workplace or school has access to Office 365, you already have access to it. You can also check out a free version of Microsoft's communication tool.</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="meetings" /><category term="lockdown" /><category term="video calls" /><summary type="html">You can finally add your own background to Microsoft Teams video chats.

The idea is to save time that would have otherwise been wasted typing phrases, sentences or entire paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espanso is an open source text template program for Windows, Mac and Linux that helps users save time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the installation, you have the choice to add Espanso to “PATH” (Windows System Variable) and to enable it to auto-start with Windows. You will also need to restart the computer to get the program working. properly; I think it requires the restart to enable the “PATH” correctly. Start the program and you should see an icon on the system tray. Right-clicking on it allows you to disable it or exit the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espanso works in all applications including Notepad, Word, Firefox, Thunderbird, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matches&quot;&gt;Matches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espanso uses the concept of Matches (keyword recognition) i.e., when you type a word that’s present in the program’s settings, it triggers the application to substitute the keyword with its configured replacement. The official wiki explains the technical details rather well, but I’ll demonstrate how it works below for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire up a text editor or browser, or any other program that accepts text input. Type the word :espanso and it will magically be replaced with the phrase “Hi there!”. In this case “:espanso” is the keyword and “Hi There” is the replaced text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mlogs/espanso/espanso_feature.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Espanso Demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t guessed it already, Espanso is the Italian word for Expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mlogs/espanso/espanso-highlighted.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Espanso Demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we customize Espanso?
Go to the application’s “Roaming” folder in your User directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This folder contains a “default.yml” file. Open it using a text editor, e.g. Notepad works just fine. Espanso uses YAML syntax, which is very user-friendly. Look at the highlighted section in the screenshot below. That’s the match trigger and replacement which I mentioned in my example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indentation is necessary for the syntax to work. So if your match isn’t being triggered correctly, check the spacing in the syntax. The other rule is to remember to use the : symbol. For e.g. :espanso vs espanso. The first one is correct, the latter won’t trigger the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-add-new-words-to-espanso&quot;&gt;How to add new words to Espanso?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try adding a new one. Write a new trigger word and choose a replacement phrase. To make it easy, you can just copy the “espanso” trigger, paste it in a new line and edit it.
Save the document, exit Espanso and start it again. Now type :ghx and it should be replaced with gHacks.net. That’s incredibly easy, isn’t it? You can use it to add email signatures, URLs, HTML Tags, commonly used phrases, responses, etc, and save some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mlogs/espanso/espanso_yml.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Espanso Demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even replace a text with an image, the syntax is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;:word&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;image_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/path/image.ext&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace word with the keyword you want and the /path/image.ext with the full path of the image’s location, followed by the name of the picture and its extension. This may not be practical in day-to-day usage, but the option is there, in case you want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Words&lt;/strong&gt;:
Espanso is fast, easy to use if you want to quickly insert words and phrases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="Espanso" /><category term="cross-platform" /><category term="linux" /><category term="mlogs" /><summary type="html">Snippet tools are incredibly useful.

#### 3. Git.Expandinizr- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githubexpandinizr/cbehdjjcilgnejbpnjhobkiiggkedfib)

Usually we do feel irritating when Github truncates the name of file or folder, to view full name we need to open that file. But with this extension this problem will be solved.

![truncate-demo]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mlogs/github/truncate.png)

Features
 - Removes the truncating of file, directory names and notifications in the repository browser
 - Really long file and directory names will word-wrap
 - Fully expands the website, with breakpoints at 1400px, 1600px and 1800px

#### 4. File Icon for GitHub - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-icon-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-file-icon/?src=search)

On GitHub, no matter what kind of file is, their icons are all same. However, in your fancy editor, there are some packages which give every filetype an unique icon.

But this extension to replace original file icon with filetype-specific icons. This improves visual recognition on GitHub, GitLab, etc.

![fileicons-demo]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mlogs/github/file-icons.jpg)

![Why Mlogs]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mlogs/why-mlogs.png)

Being a techster we want to explore more things related to tech and we feel very interesting to keep updated with updated news and applications.

Rather than combining some set of topics in a single blog we want to split these topics into mlogs to keep you updated by spending minimal amount of time.

#### Series of mlogs

There will be different series of mlogs each series will talk about different topics.
&gt; We will make sure that these mlog series will be as interesting as Netflix's web-series.

Our first mlog series will help you to understand better tricks while working with Linux and Commands in it.

Here is our first mlog - [Transferfiles between PC and mobile wirelessly by scanning QR code](https://DevsKrate.com/transfer-files-between-computer-and-mobile-wireless/)

Xiaomi Announces MIUI 12, Here is a quick overview and list of phones which is expected to get this update.
Xiaomi in its recent keynote along with its phone announcement, it also the latest version of its software skin MIUI 12. It's a slight redesign of its exciting MIUI 11 and has quite a lot of visual changes. Let's see what features does this new UI brings to the table.

**1. UI changes**:
Xiaomi has been working hard to make their UI as refined and as minimal as possible. One of the UI changes comes in the notification shade, now we change some simple basic settings like wifi, Bluetooth in the notification shade itself with a tiny window and talking about looks, it looks much similar to control center found on the IOS.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-control-center.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The use of pictorial images to represent the status and data visualization ends up bringing a fresh look to the UI and the app animation(Opening and Closing) has also gotten much smoother.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-animation.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**2. Wallpapers**:
Wallpapers are one of the biggest visual changes and Xiaomi is calling them 'Super Wallpapers' and they look very cool, their live wallpapers which are based on high precision 3D models of
earth and mars and the fact that they turn into night scene when dark mode is added is a bounce. The live wallpapers feature for now is only exclusive to High-End Xiaomi phones.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-wallpapers.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**3. Dark Mode 2.0**:
You might ask me that we already have a system-wide dark theme in MIUI 11 so what's new in this, There are a good number of improvements in it. This time the company has worked to improve the readability to reduce eye strain and the text is now brighter and sharper. Dark mode also brings a new feature called 'Wallpaper Dimming' feature that will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper(It also supports this feature for custom wallpapers.)

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

**4. MI Health App**:
Mi Health debuts in this new version of MIUI.This enables, The phone can track users steps, sleep, workouts, and other exercises but the fact that to enable the phone to do sleep tracking the phone should be in the same pillow is a bummer. 

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-health-app.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**5. Improved Gesture**:
This UI update also brings with it a slight improvement in the gestures. It now has a much lengthy bar at the bottom and much refined animations to go along with it.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-gestures.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**6. Privacy enhancement**:
Xiaomi this time along has followed a three-pronged approach to improve privacy in MIUI 12, namely Flare, Barbed Wire, and the Mask System.
**Firstly**, the flare will keep track of the app behavior of all apps on your phone and will present you the list of apps that may be violating the privacy policy or misusing permissions
and offer tips to avoid the above mishaps.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Flare privacy image&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-flare.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The **second** one is Barbed Wire, in which it offers several permission options similar to Android 10 and gives us options like for permanently allow or only when app is in use or allow only once and it even shows the icon of which app is using what services.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Barbed privacy image&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-barbed.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The **third** one is the Mask system which lets users to create and share virtual ID's when apps ask about the data, we saw a similar implementation in the Color OS 7 skin as well.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; alt=&quot;Mask&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-virtual-id.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**7. Floating window**:
Android 10 itself has the floating window feature, MI included  it to miui.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Floating window&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-floating-window.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**8. Ads**:
Talking about the Ad situation in MIUI only time has the answer.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Ads&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-ads.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**9. AI :**
AI feature is only available to china at present.

These are some of the important features coming to Xiaomi devices through MIUI 12 update.

Meta tags are the things which will do these things. 
The minimal way of creating the meta tags are
``` html
&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Tech news&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;Devs, Krate, DevsKrate, Tech&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Puneeth&quot;&gt;
```

The below are [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/), which enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph(mainly used by social media).
``` html
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;Generating Preview Links&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;article&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;https://DevsKrate.com&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;http://DevsKrate.com/image.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;A tech website for developers, where you get everything about tech&quot; /&gt; 
```

Twitter uses open graph, but for gettings previews in the cards and to be more specific, twitter has it's own meta tags. You can see how your preview works in twitter at [&quot;Twitter link preview&quot;](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

### Why Visual Studio Code 
Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

Here are some Key Benefits of using VS Code - 
* Available on Mac, Linux, and Ofcourse Windows.
* Edit, Build, and Debug very easily.
* Highly configurable - **Open-source project** 
* VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as NodeJS, JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.
* Highly robust and Extensible.
* High availability of industry and community-developed extensions.
* Much loved dark theme
