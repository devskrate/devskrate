#### Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset Pro:

![Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset Pro ]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/xiaomi-bluetooth-headset-pro.jpg)

Xiaomi has been doing well when it comes to wireless headsets and to add up in this line up the company launched a new TWS called the Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset Pro. Let's see what this has to offer.

Unlike many other TWS which come with two earbuds, this only comes with only one but you can wear it both sides since the earbud it capable of rotating 180 degrees. The headset uses a dual microphone design to reduce outside noise. It comes with a 12mm dynamic speaker for richer sound.

This is powered by Qualcomm QCC3020 wireless audio SoC. This TWS headset also comes with a 100mAH battery which can provide 8 hours of talk time on a single charger. This also comes with a charging case having 600mAH battery which further extends the battery life to about 40 hours. The case is charged using a type c port and also supports quick charger. This headset also supports  Bluetooth 5.0. 

It also features support for XiaoAI voice assistant as well as Google Assistant and Apple Siri, but if it makes it way to India we probably won't see the support for XiaoAI voice assistant. finally speaking of price it is 199 Yuan which translates to almost 2200 Rupees.

Under the hood, the device is powered by a T968-H processor, which comes with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It supports 4k resolution and is also HDR10 certified. Speaking about the brightness, it supports 2,000 ANSI Lumens, which means that users can use it even in a brighter environment without any issues.

&lt;br&gt;

+ ios    -&gt; iPhone OS
+ iPhone -&gt; Apple Phone

This leaked from 2 well known personalities and trusted sources in Twitter  @jon_prosser and @MaxWinebach.
According to them their might be the renaming of their products.

By seeing this, we may also assume apple might enter to mid-range devices.

See, assume ios is gone and became iPhone OS, but iPhone gone and Apple Phone came, but iPhone is there in the OS not as phone.

So, we may assume soon apple is going to launch a mid ranger or may be a budget phone(no Possibly ;).

So why own multiple brands in the same industry?. To understand the real reason behind it we need to look at their history.

#### The Foundation of BBK:

The founder Yong Ping Duan used to work in Subor Electronics which sold Consumer electronics like learning machines, language repeaters, electronic dictionary, reading machines, and several other products. Thereafter in 1995 stared his own company called BBK Electronics. This company also sold Consumer electronics and then further expanded into making DVD player,mp3 player, feature phone, and many more.
#### The Birth of Oppo:

This was the time when sales of BBK products started reducing and the idea to overcome the challenge was to create a subsidiary brand and this gave birth to Oppo. The brand name Oppo registered in 2001 in China and launched in 2004. Tony Chen was appointed as the CEO of the company. Oppo started making several products like DVD player,mp3 player, feature phone. The first product that they sold was OPPO OPDV971H, which was a Universal DVD player. The company entered the smartphone market in the year 2008 and just within five years it became the second most profitable company in China among other players like ZTE, Huawei, Lenovo, and Xiaomi in 2013.

The brand started it's international expansion in 2010 with Thailand, where it announced Find 3 and then later showcased the Find 5, which was followed by Find 7. It also started expanding its presence in other countries like Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many more countries. The Company's main advantage was that it operated locally in the regions and tried to understand the customer needs and make products accordingly. Speaking about the Indian market, at the time when Oppo entered the smartphone market in 2014, the market was just starting to grow and Oppo mainly used its advertising strategies to sell their phones and their Ad campaigns had a lot of emphasis on the selfie camera and now Oppo is a major player in the Indian smartphone market.  

#### The Birth of Vivo:

Did you know that most of your favourite car companies such as Lamborghini, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, and many other car companies belong to Volkswagen? BBK also wanted to imply something like this which ended up giving birth to another sub-branded arm of the BBK Electronics called Vivo and this was founded in 2009 and Shen Wei was appointed as CEO. The company designs, develops, and manufactures smartphones, accessories, software, and online services. The brand is known for it's High Fidelity audio experience. It’s a hardware-level technology that the company integrates in their handsets, started with at the time world’s slimmest smartphone, the X1, launched in 2012. The company not only works on hardware, but develops intuitive interactive systems connecting its users and phone, Thus, you can see that brand has their own customized Android-based operating system called Funtouch OS, which offers a range of smart features such as Smart Click, Super Screenshot, Single-handed mode and various other smart features on their handsets. Speaking of Indian presence, the company launched its first smartphone in India in December 2014 with the world’s slimmest smartphone at the time, the X5Max, which was priced quite premium around Rs 32,000. The company within two years has to spread into different segments like the X, Y, and V Series, and now it's one of the top five smartphone brands in India.

#### The Birth of OnePlus:

This was the time when Xioami, which most of the people know as Mi was completely disrupting the smartphone market by selling good and cheap smartphone online, this made Oppo release a new subsidiary brand in the year 2013 and named it OnePlus. Pete Lau Carl Pei was appointed as the CEO of One Plus. OnePlus followed the same strategy of selling phones online for cheaper price will Oppo and Vivo focus on the Offline market.

The company launched its first smartphone OnePlus One in the year 2014, which came with Cyanogen OS based on android was a big hit, it managed to offer flagship specs at a much lower price, but later it could not use Cyanogen in India because Micromax had a deal in which only their phones could use Cyanogen this lead to the creation of one of the best skins loved by so many people called the Oxygen Os. After the success of one plus 1 and 2, which were flagship killers, One plus wanted to make a mid-ranger phone called the OnePlus X in 2015, but that did not get much love. It later focused on Flagship Killer and even recently started making Flagship phones and it became number one in the premium market of India.

#### The birth of Realme:

While OnePlus occupied the premium market, Xioami has entirely conquered the Indian mid-range smartphone market and became the number one smartphone manufacture beating the then-leader Samsung. This gave birth to another subsidiary company called Realme, you might wonder, why not just have OnePlus launch a mid-range phone, after all, they were supposed to be the bang for buck smartphone brand for Oppo but OnePlus is not a budget smartphone brand anymore as they have slowly increased the price and they don't want to be seen as budget smartphone maker anymore. Coming back to Realme, this was founded in 2018 and Sky Li was appointed as CEO. It entered the Indian market with the Realme 1, which gave an instant hit to the company and from there they grew and now become the number four smartphone seller in India. The company further expanded into Europe and many other countries. This company main focus was to compete with Xioami, which they have been doing successfully.

#### The Birth of iQOO:

BBK saw the rise in the market for a gaming smartphone and wanted to get into the market this gave birth to the brand iQOO which is Vivo's subsidiary brand and Gagan Arora was appointed as CEO. iQOO entered the Chinese smartphone market in 2019 and Indian market in the year 2020 with the introduction with the iQOO 3 and that phone did great for the company and will be a tough competition to the remaining gaming brands and we will be exciting to see how this company turns out in the future.

Note: The fact that there are some other companies that BBK Electronics in smartphones and other electronic companies, the above were some of the game changers for BBK Electronics.

#### So why Own multiple brands?

Now to the main question why does BBK own so many subsidiary brands in the same sector? Given below are three main reasons.

1. Since you have read the above you might have already understood the fact that all these sub-brands focus at different types of customers. OnePlus focuses on those power users whose priority is speed and to get top of the line specs, while Realme mainly focuses on those people who want value smartphones and they try to offer the best value possible. Oppo and Vivo focus on offline market and camera-centric phones. iQOO aims on people whose highest priority is gaming. With this distribution of brands, they can offer different smartphones at different price points which helps them to easily conquer the entire market.

2. If one company experiences a negative reputation, remaining will not be affected.
For Ex: Maggi recently got a bad name because of objective levels of metallic lead found in it, but this did not affect the parent company nestle or it's other sub-brands.

3. Sharing of resources, since all the companies belong to the same parent company they can share their R&amp;D, factory chains, and many other things. 
For Example, OnePlus and Oppo, where OnePlus uses Oppo fast charging tech-Vooc technology and when you look at OnePLus phone's they share the same design to Oppo's phones, when you look carefully, the OnePlus One and Oppo Find 7a, you can find a lot of similarities.

#### Bigger Display and More Watch Faces:

Mi band 5 features a **1.1-inch color AMOLED touch display**, which is 20 percent bigger when compared to that of the 0.95-inch found on band 4, which we consider to be a minor upgrade but would like to have seen smaller bezels. Along with bigger display comes new faces 100 to be precise and these wallpaper will also have some renowned animated series, including Hatsune Miku, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and SpongeBob SquarePants.These can be found on the Mi Fit app.

#### More Sport Tracking:

This new Mi Band 5 has also increased the number of sport activities that the Mi band could record. Xiaomi has added **six new sport** activities to the already existing five-treadmill, exercise, outdoor running, cycling, walking, pool swimming. The six new modes-indoor running, indoor 
cycling, elliptical machine, skipping rope, yoga, and rowing machine.

#### Improved health Tracking:

This fitness tracker is equipped with a **PPG heart rate sensor**, which we found in the Realme SmartWatch, and with this Xiaomi claims a 50 percent more accurate than its predecessor. It also comes with stress monitoring and breathing exercises built into the band. It comes with improved sleep tracking. The band also has a dedicated women health Tracking which will help them track their period cycles, ovulation period, and more.

#### New Charging Method:

If you have used any of the old Mi band then you will know how hard is it to charge the Mi Band, Xiaomi solves this bring a new magnetic charger that charges which sticks to the Mi Band and charge it up with the help of contact pins.
The Mi Band 5 now comes with a smaller 125mAH battery than the 135mAH battery of its predecessor but Xiaomi still claims the same 20-day battery life even with a bigger display and a smaller battery, how true is it? It can be only told once the watch comes in India.

#### Verdict:

Mi Band 5 has **three minor changes**-Bigger Display, More Sport Tracking, Improved health Tracking, and **one major update** in terms of charging. We think the upgrade is not a major but still a notable one. If anyone who already owns a Mi Band 4 you need not consider the 5, but if you are planning to buy a fitness tracker, then you probably can wait for the band 5. Several leaks claim that the Band 5 will be launching next month.</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="Mi" /><category term="MiBand" /><category term="Fitness Tracker" /><summary type="html">The Mi band has been one of the most successful lineups for Xioami and it recently announced the successor to Mi Band 4, The Mi Band 5 in China.

The folks at XDA Developer have spotted several references about the TWS(‘true wireless stereo’) in the Android 11 beta code. This TWS can be named as One Plus Pods, but at this point, we are a bit skeptical.

There is also mention of 'oppoPodsService' in the code, which can mean that the companies will be sharing the technologies and we can expect to see some hardware lend from the Oppo Enco Free or the Enco W31. We can expect to see this product getting launched in two to three months alongside the One Plus’s mid-range phone One Plus Z.</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="OnePlus" /><category term="TWS" /><category term="Leaks" /><summary type="html">One Plus has once been known for its flagship killer smartphones and then as the time passed they started expanding into several other product lineups like a real flagship, Bluetooth earphones and many more and now one plus is planning to add to a new member to its family, a new true wireless buds.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus-buds-banner.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus-buds-banner.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Snapdragon 690 with 5G support for budget phones</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/qualcomm-launched-snapdragon-690-with-5G/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Snapdragon 690 with 5G support for budget phones" /><published>2020-06-17T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-06-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/qualcomm-launched-snapdragon-690-with-5G</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/qualcomm-launched-snapdragon-690-with-5G/">We have seen Qualcomm forcing manufactures to include 5G with the latest flagship  Snapdragon 865, by not selling a separate version a separate 865 without 5G. We have also seen the company include its 5G modem(X51 modem) to the 700 series chips with SnapDragon 765 5G and now Qualcomm has decided to add the 5G modem to 600 series of chipset with the introduction of SnapDragon 690 processor.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/android/snapdragon-690-specs.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;Snapdragon 690&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/android/snapdragon-690-specs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This new Snapdragon 690 is an 8nm processor, which will be a successor to Snapdragon 675. The processor will come Kryo 560 CPU and Adreno 619L GPU, which will offer 20 percent better CPU performance and 60 percent faster graphics rendering compared to the Snapdragon 675. It will also have support for high-end features like support 120Hz displays for faster refresh rates, 4K HDR video capture, and up to 192-megapixel camera sensor support.

Speaking of connectivity, It will have support for Wifi standard like Wifi 6, Wifi 5, and Wifi 2.4GHZ and it will come with Bluetooth 5.1 support as well. This processor will have support for HDR 10 and HDR 10 Plus. It will come with Qualcomm AI Engine support. It will also have support for Fingerprint, Iris, Voice, and Face for Biometric authentication. It supports Quick Charge 4+ standard for fast charging. It will have support for GPS, NavIC, Dual Frequency, NFC, and other sensor support.    

Here are the complete specs released by snapdragon -


&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/android/snapdragon-690-details.jpg&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-2&quot; data-title=&quot;Snapdragon 690&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/android/snapdragon-690-details.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The 5G modem in this will only support slower sub-6GHz versions of 5G, not the faster mmWave standard. This 5G modem in this chipset will allow for a wider adoption of this technology. We can see 5G enabled smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 690 in the year 2021 at a price point of 10,000 to 20,000 rupees.

Let's see what this phone has offer.

#### Design and Display:
Talking about the design, It's a plastic build phone with a notch-less design on the front. The screen is IPS LCD with a size 6.5 inch. It's an FHD screen with 1,080x2,340 resolution and a refresh rate of 60Hz. We would have loved to see either a higher refresh or an AMOLED screen. 

#### Internals and software:
Speaking of internals, it is powered by the Qualcomm-Snapdragon 730G which is coupled by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage and you can also expand the storage up to a 1TB using the Hybrid sim slot. It also comes with Bluetooth v5, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and Dual 4G VoLTE for connectivity.  Speaking of software, It's My UX running on top of Android 10, which is almost a stock Android-like experience with a few additional tweaks to enhance the user experience.

#### Camera:
This phone comes with a Quad-Rear camera setup, The primary camera being a 64 MP lens. The second sensor and the highlight of the phone is the  8MP wide-angle lens. The third is a 5MP Macro lens and the last one is a 2MP depth sensor. Speaking of selfie camera, we have a 16MP sensor.

#### Pricing and Verdict:
Moto decided to price the 6G RAM and 128GB ROM at 16,999, At this price, this is competing against the likes of Realme 6, Realme X2, Samsung M31, Vivo Z1x, Redmi Note 9 Pro and Pro Max. We think it's a good smartphone, if what you what is a stock android like experience and a full-screen notch-less display this might suit you the best.
