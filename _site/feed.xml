Realme X3 SuperZoom was first launched in Europe earlier last month while it is the first time that the company is talking about the regular Realme X3. Lets see what this phone has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-and-display&quot;&gt;Design and Display:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the design, it’s a glass sandwich build which is held together by a plastic frame. It is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back. This phone comes with dual punch-hole cutouts to accommodate two cameras. Speaking of display it comes with 6.6 inch 120Hz IPS LCD panel, 120 Hz is good but would have loved to see Amoled instead of the IPS LCD. Since it is an LCD panel it comes with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/realme/realmex3-display.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Realme X3 series Display and design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internals-and-software&quot;&gt;Internals and software:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of internals, It comes with the previous year’s flagship processor from Qualcomm-Snapdragon 855 plus, which still is quite fast. It will come with the option to spec the phone up to 12 GB LPDRR4x RAM and 256 GB UFS 3.0 internal storage. It will not support 5G but it will come with Bluetooth 5.0, dual-frequency GPS, and WiFi 802.11ac for connectivity. It also comes with liquid cooling chamber to keep the temperature on check. Speaking of battery capacity, This phone will have 4200 mAh and a 30W charger for fast charging. Coming to Software, it comes with Realme UI based on Android 10 running the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;camera&quot;&gt;Camera:&lt;/h4&gt;

The third is an 8MP ultra-wide with a 115-degree FOV and the last one is a 2MP macro lens. The regular Realme X3 replaces the periscope camera for a standard 12MP telephoto sensor with 2x optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the Selfie camera, Both come with a dual-camera setup inside the punch hole but with different sensors, the SuperZoom comes with 32MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor with a 105-degree FOV, while the regular comes with 16MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

The new operating system brings a redesigned home screen and much-needed features to catch up with what Android has to offer.

+ **App Library:**
This feature allows us to access and organize our apps much easier by creating a new space called the App library at the end of the home screen pages. It creates folders based on the type of apps and even has a separate folder for frequently used apps. It even has the option to hide pages, which you don't use.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-app-library.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;ios14 App Library&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-app-library.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

+ **Improved Widgets:**
Anything we miss when we switch from Android to iOS is a lack of widgets on the home screen. This feature now lets you do just that, not only that you can even resize your widgets according to your wish. This even has a widget gallery, which contains all the available widgets available for a particular app. There’s also a new “Smart Stack” widget that automatically shows relevant apps based on the time of day.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-widgets.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-widgets.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

+ **Picture - In- Picture Mode for Videos:**
Apple finally added system-wide picture-in-picture mode to iOS 14, which basically lets you hover over apps and adjust in size and you can even collapse into the side of the display to continue playing in the background.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-pip.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-pip.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

+ **Siri:**
The most annoying thing when you call for Siri is that it takes up the whole screen and Apple addresses this problem with the introduction of a new compact design, there’s just a small animated Siri icon at the bottom. Siri can now take answers from the website. Siri can now help send audio messages in addition to just dictated messages.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-siri.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-siri.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

+ **Translate App:**
Apple also introduced a new Translate app that will come built-in with iOS 14. It will allow users to easily translate between languages. Users will be able to enter text in or dictate messages and have them translated into 11 languages. English, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian will all be supported at launch and the fact that it is available offline makes it even more useful.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-translate.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-translate.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

+ **Messages:**
Messages are also getting new features in iOS 14, now you will be able to pin important conversations to the top of the Message app to easily talk to your favorite friends or group chats. There is also 20 new hairstyle and even mask option and even ages options for memojis and there is also an option for groups inline replies, which helps to keep track of the conversations happening in the groups.

+ **Apple Maps:**
Apple Maps is getting new, curated guides from companies like Zagat or AllTrails to give better recommendations for new places. Maps is also giving a new option for cycling, with dedicated directions for bike-riding. Cycling will launch in NYC, LA, San Fransisco’s Bay Area, Shanghai, and Beijing. There is also a new EV Routing feature, which will track the current charge of your car and route you to compatible stations.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-maps.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-maps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

+ **CarPlay and Carkeys:**
CarPlay is getting support for custom wallpapers and new app categories: parking apps, EV chargers, and fast food takeout apps.CarKeys will let you leave your keys at home and use your iPhone as a key to lock/unlock your car. You can even share the hey using messages app and you can even apply a restricted driving profile. This feature will not only be an iOS 14 exclusive but will be supported iniOS 13 as well. The 2021 BMW 5 Series will be the first car to come with support for car keys.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-keys.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;image-1&quot; data-title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/apple/wwdc2020/ios14-keys.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

+ **AppClips:**
AppClips will let users access a small part of the app that you need without downloading the app. The new feature is meant to help users have quick access to the app. When you scan a QR code, a dedicated App Clip code or NFC tags, your iPhone will launch the App Clip card. You can tap Open to launch the app without downloading it. App Clips are compatible with Apple Pay and Sign in with Apple. This means you don't have to make an account with an app or use your credit card information. Users will be able to pay for takeout, parking, and learn more about local businesses just by scanning.
iOS 14 will be out this fall, but a developer preview will be available to Apple Developer Program members starting today, with plans for a public beta for all iOS users in July. iOS 14 will work on the iPhone 6S and up — the same devices that supported iOS 13.

#### iPad OS:

+ iPadOS 14, the latest version of iPadOS brings everything that iOS 14 packs, with some major redesign to how the interface looks on iPad's large screens. 
Siri is also getting a makeover on the iPadOS, it's now a lesser space with only a small icon on the bottom right corner, much like the iOS. 

+ The ipadOS also borrows features like universal search from macOS, which also you to not only on your home screens but also on any app. The ipadOS also brought several features to productivity apps like photos, calendars and redesigned them to make use of the much bigger screen real-estate available.

+ With this ipadOS update, Apple focused on making the already useful Apple Pencil much more useful. Apple Pencil now gets Scribble mode, which turns your scribbling into proper texts. This text can be copied and pasted anywhere. 

+ You can use scribble mode in the search menu as well. The iPadOS is getting a compact screen window for calls.The developer beta of iPadOS 14 is available today while the stable versions will launch this fall.

#### macOS:

Apple named its latest macOS as Big Sur. The biggest change is the new look. This is what Apple considers the biggest redesign after the introduction of macOS 10. 

Like the ipadOS, macOS takes much of its queues from iOS, including a control center for customizing brightness, Do Not Disturb, and several other settings. It also adds a new notification center, which keeps all of your notifications and widgets. It also brings pinned messages and several other message feature to the mac's message app. Apple maps also have the same feature changes to that of iOS 14.

Big Sur also features improvements to its core applications. Safari now features a new start page with customizable background images and sections like Reading List and iCloud Tabs. It also adds Safari can now also detect when you're on a page with non-native language and offer to translate it for you similar to google translate on chrome. 

The tab UI has also been changed with increased size and preview for tabs and the ability to close all the tabs which are right of the selected tab. 

Apple also claims Safari to the faster browser. Apple has also improved extension support, which allows developers to bring in their extensions from other browsers, which can be found on the Mac App Store but they can only access your data once you allow them. Safari also shows which trackers are being blocked by the browser.

Apple also announced the Mac platform will now be transferred to ARM and apple will be making its own A-series custom chipsets and Apple promises to bring its first ARM-powered machine by the end of the year and the transition from Intel to ARM will take two years.

+ Face Sharing, which lets you share watch face with others. These will be available as curated watch faces in the Apple Watch app store or shareable between individuals or as links on social media sites.

+ In the time of current pandemic washing hands have become much more important and to help users do it correctly this watchOS comes with a hand-washing detection system, which sets a countdown to tell you how long to keep washing to match the amount of time recommended by health officials.
+ The update will release this fall for the Apple Watch Series 3 and later, meaning Apple is dropping support for the Series 1 and Series 2. You’ll need at least an iPhone 6S or later running iOS 14 to support watchOS 7.

Xiaomi has been doing well when it comes to wireless headsets and to add up in this line up the company launched a new TWS called the Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset Pro. Let's see what this has to offer.

Unlike many other TWS which come with two earbuds, this only comes with only one but you can wear it both sides since the earbud it capable of rotating 180 degrees. The headset uses a dual microphone design to reduce outside noise. It comes with a 12mm dynamic speaker for richer sound.

This is powered by Qualcomm QCC3020 wireless audio SoC. This TWS headset also comes with a 100mAH battery which can provide 8 hours of talk time on a single charger. This also comes with a charging case having 600mAH battery which further extends the battery life to about 40 hours. The case is charged using a type c port and also supports quick charger. This headset also supports  Bluetooth 5.0. 

It also features support for XiaoAI voice assistant as well as Google Assistant and Apple Siri, but if it makes it way to India we probably won't see the support for XiaoAI voice assistant. finally speaking of price it is 199 Yuan which translates to almost 2200 Rupees.

#### Redmi AX5 Wi-Fi 6 Router:

Talking about the design, it comes in white color with four independent antennae to provide a better coverage area. This router also supports mesh network, which means you can connect multiple of them to cover a wider area.

Speaking of Speed, the company claims router can support speeds of up to 1775Mbps which is about 52 percent faster than Wi-Fi  5. It can also support a stable connection for up to 128 Wi-Fi-enabled devices, which comes in handy, if you have a smart home with multiple devices like Smart TV, speakers, security cameras and more.

Xiaomi, also launched a projector called the Mi Laser Projector 1S 4K. The highlight of this projector has to be the fact that it can use short-focus that allows the device to cast from 80 inches and up to 150 inches from just a few centimeters away and the company claims that an 80-inch screen can be cast when the projector is placed just 5.5-inch away and for the maximum 150-inch display, the projector needs to be placed at a distance of at least 19 inches, which is of great convenience.

Under the hood, the device is powered by a T968-H processor, which comes with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It supports 4k resolution and is also HDR10 certified. Speaking about the brightness, it supports 2,000 ANSI Lumens, which means that users can use it even in a brighter environment without any issues.

&lt;br&gt;

+ ios    -&gt; iPhone OS
+ iPhone -&gt; Apple Phone

This leaked from 2 well known personalities and trusted sources in Twitter  @jon_prosser and @MaxWinebach.
According to them their might be the renaming of their products.

By seeing this, we may also assume apple might enter to mid-range devices.

See, assume ios is gone and became iPhone OS, but iPhone gone and Apple Phone came, but iPhone is there in the OS not as phone.

So, we may assume soon apple is going to launch a mid ranger or may be a budget phone(no Possibly ;).

So why own multiple brands in the same industry?. To understand the real reason behind it we need to look at their history.

#### The Foundation of BBK:

The founder Yong Ping Duan used to work in Subor Electronics which sold Consumer electronics like learning machines, language repeaters, electronic dictionary, reading machines, and several other products. Thereafter in 1995 stared his own company called BBK Electronics. This company also sold Consumer electronics and then further expanded into making DVD player,mp3 player, feature phone, and many more.
#### The Birth of Oppo:

This was the time when sales of BBK products started reducing and the idea to overcome the challenge was to create a subsidiary brand and this gave birth to Oppo. The brand name Oppo registered in 2001 in China and launched in 2004. Tony Chen was appointed as the CEO of the company. Oppo started making several products like DVD player,mp3 player, feature phone. The first product that they sold was OPPO OPDV971H, which was a Universal DVD player. The company entered the smartphone market in the year 2008 and just within five years it became the second most profitable company in China among other players like ZTE, Huawei, Lenovo, and Xiaomi in 2013.

The brand started it's international expansion in 2010 with Thailand, where it announced Find 3 and then later showcased the Find 5, which was followed by Find 7. It also started expanding its presence in other countries like Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many more countries. The Company's main advantage was that it operated locally in the regions and tried to understand the customer needs and make products accordingly. Speaking about the Indian market, at the time when Oppo entered the smartphone market in 2014, the market was just starting to grow and Oppo mainly used its advertising strategies to sell their phones and their Ad campaigns had a lot of emphasis on the selfie camera and now Oppo is a major player in the Indian smartphone market.  

#### The Birth of Vivo:

Did you know that most of your favourite car companies such as Lamborghini, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, and many other car companies belong to Volkswagen? BBK also wanted to imply something like this which ended up giving birth to another sub-branded arm of the BBK Electronics called Vivo and this was founded in 2009 and Shen Wei was appointed as CEO. The company designs, develops, and manufactures smartphones, accessories, software, and online services. The brand is known for it's High Fidelity audio experience. It’s a hardware-level technology that the company integrates in their handsets, started with at the time world’s slimmest smartphone, the X1, launched in 2012. The company not only works on hardware, but develops intuitive interactive systems connecting its users and phone, Thus, you can see that brand has their own customized Android-based operating system called Funtouch OS, which offers a range of smart features such as Smart Click, Super Screenshot, Single-handed mode and various other smart features on their handsets. Speaking of Indian presence, the company launched its first smartphone in India in December 2014 with the world’s slimmest smartphone at the time, the X5Max, which was priced quite premium around Rs 32,000. The company within two years has to spread into different segments like the X, Y, and V Series, and now it's one of the top five smartphone brands in India.

#### The Birth of OnePlus:

This was the time when Xioami, which most of the people know as Mi was completely disrupting the smartphone market by selling good and cheap smartphone online, this made Oppo release a new subsidiary brand in the year 2013 and named it OnePlus. Pete Lau Carl Pei was appointed as the CEO of One Plus. OnePlus followed the same strategy of selling phones online for cheaper price will Oppo and Vivo focus on the Offline market.

The company launched its first smartphone OnePlus One in the year 2014, which came with Cyanogen OS based on android was a big hit, it managed to offer flagship specs at a much lower price, but later it could not use Cyanogen in India because Micromax had a deal in which only their phones could use Cyanogen this lead to the creation of one of the best skins loved by so many people called the Oxygen Os. After the success of one plus 1 and 2, which were flagship killers, One plus wanted to make a mid-ranger phone called the OnePlus X in 2015, but that did not get much love. It later focused on Flagship Killer and even recently started making Flagship phones and it became number one in the premium market of India.

#### The birth of Realme:

While OnePlus occupied the premium market, Xioami has entirely conquered the Indian mid-range smartphone market and became the number one smartphone manufacture beating the then-leader Samsung. This gave birth to another subsidiary company called Realme, you might wonder, why not just have OnePlus launch a mid-range phone, after all, they were supposed to be the bang for buck smartphone brand for Oppo but OnePlus is not a budget smartphone brand anymore as they have slowly increased the price and they don't want to be seen as budget smartphone maker anymore. Coming back to Realme, this was founded in 2018 and Sky Li was appointed as CEO. It entered the Indian market with the Realme 1, which gave an instant hit to the company and from there they grew and now become the number four smartphone seller in India. The company further expanded into Europe and many other countries. This company main focus was to compete with Xioami, which they have been doing successfully.

#### The Birth of iQOO:

BBK saw the rise in the market for a gaming smartphone and wanted to get into the market this gave birth to the brand iQOO which is Vivo's subsidiary brand and Gagan Arora was appointed as CEO. iQOO entered the Chinese smartphone market in 2019 and Indian market in the year 2020 with the introduction with the iQOO 3 and that phone did great for the company and will be a tough competition to the remaining gaming brands and we will be exciting to see how this company turns out in the future.

Note: The fact that there are some other companies that BBK Electronics in smartphones and other electronic companies, the above were some of the game changers for BBK Electronics.

#### So why Own multiple brands?

Now to the main question why does BBK own so many subsidiary brands in the same sector? Given below are three main reasons.

1. Since you have read the above you might have already understood the fact that all these sub-brands focus at different types of customers. OnePlus focuses on those power users whose priority is speed and to get top of the line specs, while Realme mainly focuses on those people who want value smartphones and they try to offer the best value possible. Oppo and Vivo focus on offline market and camera-centric phones. iQOO aims on people whose highest priority is gaming. With this distribution of brands, they can offer different smartphones at different price points which helps them to easily conquer the entire market.

2. If one company experiences a negative reputation, remaining will not be affected.
For Ex: Maggi recently got a bad name because of objective levels of metallic lead found in it, but this did not affect the parent company nestle or it's other sub-brands.

3. Sharing of resources, since all the companies belong to the same parent company they can share their R&amp;D, factory chains, and many other things. 
For Example, OnePlus and Oppo, where OnePlus uses Oppo fast charging tech-Vooc technology and when you look at OnePLus phone's they share the same design to Oppo's phones, when you look carefully, the OnePlus One and Oppo Find 7a, you can find a lot of similarities.

#### Bigger Display and More Watch Faces:

Mi band 5 features a **1.1-inch color AMOLED touch display**, which is 20 percent bigger when compared to that of the 0.95-inch found on band 4, which we consider to be a minor upgrade but would like to have seen smaller bezels. Along with bigger display comes new faces 100 to be precise and these wallpaper will also have some renowned animated series, including Hatsune Miku, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and SpongeBob SquarePants.These can be found on the Mi Fit app.

#### More Sport Tracking:

This new Mi Band 5 has also increased the number of sport activities that the Mi band could record. Xiaomi has added **six new sport** activities to the already existing five-treadmill, exercise, outdoor running, cycling, walking, pool swimming. The six new modes-indoor running, indoor 
cycling, elliptical machine, skipping rope, yoga, and rowing machine.

#### Improved health Tracking:

This fitness tracker is equipped with a **PPG heart rate sensor**, which we found in the Realme SmartWatch, and with this Xiaomi claims a 50 percent more accurate than its predecessor. It also comes with stress monitoring and breathing exercises built into the band. It comes with improved sleep tracking. The band also has a dedicated women health Tracking which will help them track their period cycles, ovulation period, and more.

#### New Charging Method:

If you have used any of the old Mi band then you will know how hard is it to charge the Mi Band, Xiaomi solves this bring a new magnetic charger that charges which sticks to the Mi Band and charge it up with the help of contact pins.
The Mi Band 5 now comes with a smaller 125mAH battery than the 135mAH battery of its predecessor but Xiaomi still claims the same 20-day battery life even with a bigger display and a smaller battery, how true is it? It can be only told once the watch comes in India.

#### Verdict:

Mi Band 5 has **three minor changes**-Bigger Display, More Sport Tracking, Improved health Tracking, and **one major update** in terms of charging. We think the upgrade is not a major but still a notable one. If anyone who already owns a Mi Band 4 you need not consider the 5, but if you are planning to buy a fitness tracker, then you probably can wait for the band 5. Several leaks claim that the Band 5 will be launching next month.</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="Mi" /><category term="MiBand" /><category term="Fitness Tracker" /><summary type="html">The Mi band has been one of the most successful lineups for Xioami and it recently announced the successor to Mi Band 4, The Mi Band 5 in China.
