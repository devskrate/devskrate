**1.** First clone the SDK from
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**2.** Now, extract it in the desired location(preferred 'home' directory) by either right clicking and extract or by 
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;tar xf flutter_linux_v1.12.13+hotfix.8-stable.tar.xz&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; tar xf flutter_linux_v1.12.13+hotfix.8-stable.tar.xz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**3.** Now add flutter to your PATH
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text='export PATH=&quot;$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin&quot;' data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; export PATH=&quot;$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**4.** The last step is running
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;flutter doctor&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; flutter doctor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This command checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window. The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter; it is not necessary to install Dart separately. Check the output carefully for other software you might need to install or further tasks to perform (shown in bold text).

**Note: Android studio is mandatory for running Flutter**

##### After this many people may face issues with android studio. For example like this
```
[-] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    ‚Ä¢ Android SDK at /Users/obiwan/Library/Android/sdk
    ‚úó Android SDK is missing command line tools; download from https://goo.gl/XxQghQ
    ‚Ä¢ Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,
      visit https://flutter.dev/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
```

#### To, resolve these issues even after installing Android studio, follow the below steps

**1.** Open android studio and then goto settings and then Android SDK.

![Android-studio-settings-sdk]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/flutter-install-1.png)

**2.** Now UNCHECK the &quot;Hide Obsolete packages&quot; and then verify all the below mentioned are installed.
+ Android SDK Build-Tools
+ Android SDK Command-line Tools
+ Android SDK Platform-Tools
+ Android SDK Tools(Obsolete) [This is generally hidden until you uncheck the Hide Obsolete Packages]

![Android-SDK-Tools(Obsolete)-Install]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/android/flutter-install-2.png)

Install(Tick all the above and click apply, wait until download and installation of the above packages) the above packages.

Then, goto Terminal and run
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-excerpt__code &quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;code-excerpt__copy-btn btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-clipboard-text=&quot;flutter doctor&quot; data-original-title=&quot;Copy code&quot;&gt;  &lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; flutter doctor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By this time it should work. If it is not working close and open the terminal and set the PATH and try again.</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="os" /><category term="linux" /><category term="windows" /><category term="student" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">Get the Flutter SDK</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/flutter.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/flutter.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Xiaomi‚Äôs MI Laptop‚Äôs Finally Coming To India</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/xiaomi-laptops-mi-notebooks-india/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Xiaomi‚Äôs MI Laptop's Finally Coming To India" /><published>2020-05-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/xiaomi-laptops-mi-notebooks-india</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/xiaomi-laptops-mi-notebooks-india/">In China, Xiaomi has disrupted the laptop market in 2016 with the introduction of the Mi Notebook, It was such a good value for money product, **most reviewers ended calling it a steal**.

This smart tv comes in two sizes the 32 and the 43-inch. The main differentiator apart from size is that the 32 inch comes with an HD screen whereas the 43-inch comes with a full HD, while the rest of the specifications remain the same.


#### Display:
Realme's tv as mentioned above comes in at two sizes namely the 32 and the 43 inch. These **LED Back-Light displays** comes with chroma boost picture engine to enhance the overall picture quality and improve the brightness, color, contrast, and clarity to deliver stunning visuals. The TV supports up to 400 nits of brightness and up to 178-degree viewing angles. It also has support HDR 10 and HLG and it offers seven display modes starting from standard, sport, movie, user, energy-saving, game to vivid mode for more customized picture quality.

![RealmeTV Display]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/2020-realmetv-display.png)

#### Design:
The stand-out feature of this Tv has to be its design. It comes an almost bezel-less design, which Realme is calling **Premium Bezel-less Design**. The size of the bezel is as thin as 8.7mm on the top and around the sides, but the bottom bezel is a bit thicker and it houses the realme logo. You can either prop up the TV or wall-mount it, that's entirely up to your choice.

![RealmeTV Design]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/realmetv-design.jpg)

#### Software:
This smart TV comes with **Andriod TV 9.0**, which is Google‚Äôs latest OS for television sets. There are no additional skins on top and that's a good thing. It comes with Youtube, Prime Video, Netflix, and Live TV pre-installed. You can also download more apps and games from the play store. It also comes with chrome-cast built-in,to syn content of your phone with the TV. Since it is an android TV, It also comes with google assistant of hands-free voice commands.

![RealmeTV Android TV 9.0]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/realmeTV-software.jpg)

#### Internals:
Powering this TV is the quad-core 64-bit MediaTek chipset (featuring ARM Cortex A53 CPU, clocked at up to 1.1GHz) and Mali-470 MP3 GPU. It comes with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of ROM. The TV comes with a 24W quad-speaker(2 speakers and 2 tweeters) with Dolby Audio support for rich sound stage.

#### Ports and Connectivity:
Speaking about connectivity it comes with 2.4GHZ WIFI, Bluetooth 5.0, and more. The fact that this does not come with WIFI 5 standard is a bit of a letdown.

![RealmeTV Ports]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/realme/realmeTV-ports.jpg)

This TV  comes with a decent port selection, 3x HDMI, 2x USB, 1x Ethernet, 1x SPDIF, 1x AV port, 1x antenna in port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. 

#### Realme Smart TV: Remote
The remote looks similar to another smart remote from XIAOMI and ONE PLUS. It comes with a power On/Off button, a mute button, a Circular button for navigation at the top.below the circular button is the back, home, and settings button. Below them are the quick buttons for Netflix, YouTube, and Prime Video. It also comes with assistant button for quick voice commands and a plus, minus buttons to the left and right side of it, to increase and decrease volume. It can be operated both via the infrared and Bluetooth.

Millions of developers rely on GitHub for software development to make it more fun and collaborative.
The tool `gh` brings the [GitHub](https://github.com/) experience right to your terminal.


#### Installation 
You can install GitHub CLI today on most of the Operating Systems available -
- macOS     
- Windows     
- Linux     

Install this from [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation-and-upgrading)

It‚Äôs available today for GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud, but not yet available for GitHub Enterprise Server. This will have support support for Enterprise Server when it‚Äôs out of beta.

#### How to use?
`gh` currently suppports with `issues` and `pull requests` because many developers use them every day. Here are few examples provided by GitHub on how `gh` can improve your experience when contributing to an open source project.

- #####  Filter lists to your needs
    Find an open source project you want to contribute to and clone the repository. And then, to see where maintainers want community contributions, use `gh` to **filter the issues** to only show those with `help-wanted` labels.

    ![gh-example1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli1.png)

- #####  Quickly view the details
    Find an **issue** describing a bug that seems like something you can fix, and use `gh` to quickly open it in the browser to get all the details you need to get started. 
         
    ![gh-example2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli2.png)

- #####  Create a pull request
    Create a **branch**, make several commits to fix the bug described in the issue, and use `gh` to create a *pull request* to share your contribution. By using GitHub CLI to create *pull requests*, it also automatically creates a fork when you don‚Äôt already have one, and it pushes your branch and creates your *pull request* to get your change merged

    ![gh-example3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli3.png)

- #####  View the status of your work
    Get a quick snapshot the next morning of what happened since you created your *pull request*. `gh` shows the review and check **status** of your *pull requests*

    ![gh-example4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli4.png)

- #####  Easily check out pull requests
    One of the maintainers reviewed your *pull request* and requested changes. You probably switched branches since then, so use `gh` to checkout the *pull request* branch. We never remember the right commands either! Make the changes, push them, and soon enough the pull request is merged‚Äîcongratulations!

    ![gh-example5]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mlogs/github/gh-cli5.png)

#### Why should we use this?   

Generally we may get a doubt, why should I use it, here are some of it's features. They are:

##### 1. Security is integrated

Node.js allows you to access read and write into the filesystem, access environment variables, make outgoing requests, etc. As well as it also opens up a security risk if you are not careful when writing code.

So instead, Deno uses command-line arguments to enable or disable access to different security features. So if you need your script to be able to access the /etc folder, you can do:
 
```sh
deno --allow-read=/etc myscript.ts
```
It will allow your code to read from the folder, anything else and you‚Äôll get a security exception. This is similar to how other platforms handle security. 

##### 2. Complete standard library

Deno claims to have a complete standard library allowing developers to use official tools to perform basic tasks and only requiring the use of external libraries for complex tasks and it comes with the tools to add color to terminal text, generate UUIDs, work with external data structures,  and for writing WebSockets.

##### 3. Integrated Typescript

In Deno, by default the integration into JavaScript is done internally, so no need for external tooling. By default Deno takes care of a lot, you can overwrite the configuration by using your own tsconfig.json file:

```sh
deno run -c tsconfig.json [your-script.ts]
```
The default configuration of Deno is to use strict mode, so any ill-advised coding practice will be alerted immediately.


#### Deno Installation

Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below: 

##### Using Shell (macOS, Linux):
```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```
##### Using PowerShell (Windows):
```sh

Back then, Slack began as an internal tool for Stewart Butterfield's company Tiny Speck during the development of Glitch, an online game. Then Slack was launched in August 2013.

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/slack-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Slack&quot; title=&quot;Slack&quot; /&gt;   

In 2016, Satya Nadella and Bill Gates met up to discuss an important matter. They wanted to bid 8 billion USD to acquire Slack, the SaaS giant that dominated the team chat app space. The meeting had a surprising conclusion: instead of buying Slack, they decided to build their own team chat app tool. In November 2016, Microsoft Teams was officially launched.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/teams-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Teams&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft Teams&quot; /&gt;  

And now, both Teams and Slack had gained a good amount of daily active users.  

#### Choosing between Slack and Microsoft Teams for your next collaboration tool? Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the differences between the two, so you can choose the platform that best suits the needs of your team.  

Talking about features, there is a large difference in both of then. They're

### Microsoft Teams integrations vs Slack integrations  

 Microsoft Teams and Slack take slightly different approaches to integration with other apps.  

#### Slack integrations  
Slack boasts a ton of integrations with a variety of different apps‚Äîmore than 800 for paid plans, to be exact.  
&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/slack-integrations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slack Integrations&quot; title=&quot;Slack Integrations&quot; /&gt;   
The sheer number and variety of apps available means that you can customize your Slack workspace to make your workflow seamless.  

#### Microsoft Teams integrations  

While Slack offers more options for customization, Microsoft Teams takes a different approach‚Äîoffering a full-fledged collaboration platform with many different functionalities built in from day one.  

Essentially, Teams isn't meant to be a standalone tool. It's a fully integrated Office 365 collaboration hub, allowing users to move seamlessly between tasks and apps within the Teams window.  

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/internet/teams-integrations.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Teams Integrations&quot; title=&quot;Teams Integrations&quot; /&gt;   


### Wrapping up  

Here are some of our conclusions regarding Slack vs. Microsoft Teams.  

**Pricing:** Both Teams and Slack have freemium plans. When it comes to the paid plans, the cheapest Microsoft Teams plan is less expensive than Slack‚Äôs cheapest plan. MT wins this roound.  

**Layout and design:** The layout in Microsoft Teams has far too many tabs. On the other hand, there is less to see immediately in Slack because they want to improve their user interface. Moreover, Slack has more options to customize the app‚Äôs look.  

**Messaging:** Both Teams and Slack have different ways to send and receive messages, including threads. Microsoft Teams has more built-in options to format your text, and in return, Slack lets you set reminders for individual messages.  

**File sharing and collaboration:** Microsoft Teams lets you share Office files and work on them immediately from the workspace. Slack doesn‚Äôt come with the option of editing documents from the workspace, so you have to download files and open them in specific apps to edit them.  

**Video calls:** Both apps allow video calls and the feature works very well. However, Teams has a built-in video recording feature, which is really neat. Moreover, MT allows up to 250 people in a single call when you‚Äôre on a paid plan, compared to Slack which allows 15 people at a time.  

**Integrations:** While Microsoft Teams has excellent native integrations with Office and some third-party app integrations, Slack definitely wins in this department ‚Äì it has more than 800 integrations that you can use.  

**Summary:** Both apps are a good choice but they are catered for different needs. If you want lots of third-party integrations and the ability to customize your app to a great extent go with **Slack**.

On the other hand, **Microsoft Teams** works really well for companies that do a lot of work Office 365 and who already pay for that service.  

If you are planning to use free version, then Microsoft Teams would suit you the best because, there are are a lot more features in Microsoft Teams than Slack. May be this is the reason why, Microsoft Teams had a larger user base.</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="microsoft teams" /><category term="communication" /><category term="trends" /><category term="comparsion" /><summary type="html">Both Microsoft Teams and Slack are collaboration platform tools that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/internet/slack-vs-teams.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/internet/slack-vs-teams.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">5 cool Linux apps</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/5-cool-linux-apps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5 cool Linux apps" /><published>2020-05-22T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-22T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/5-cool-linux-apps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/5-cool-linux-apps/">In the recent days many people are tending towards linux use.

With the culture shift that comes along with remote work, it‚Äôs fair to say that collaboration is already starting to be different.

[GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/), always helps the next generation of developers to make their best in work. Now, more than ever, students need opportunities to sustain their growth. Github together with their partners **Major League Hacking (MLH)**, solving this problem with a new program‚Äîthe **MLH Fellowship**, Powered by **GitHub**. This remote program matches up *pods* of 8-10 students with **open-source projects and mentors** over a period of 12 weeks. Students will receive a stipend for the program through **GitHub Sponsors**.

![github-quote](https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/80812907-e87bbc80-8b96-11ea-914b-8a35398996a4.jpg?ssl=1)

Not just GitHub, many other tech companies will come together and fuel this ecosystem. To kick off the program, GitHub Education plans to support **100 MLH Fellows** in the inaugural class of summer 2020. These are the other partners who're joining this coalition Facebook, DEV, and the Royal Bank of Canada.

This is how GitHub describes about MLH Fellowship

##### GitHub's vision: Workforce innovation to meet student demand

Enterprises want to stay competitive with recent graduates, and internship programs often provide that edge. Internships also serve as a credential: For future hiring managers, an internship with a top tech company is a good indication of a quality candidate.

But for students, many, many more of them apply for those coveted roles than there are positions to fill. For most students, a summer in Silicon Valley is often out of the question for those aspiring developers, maintainers, and engineering managers. In partnering with MLH, we‚Äôre looking to welcome a new global workforce that is trained in real-world workflows and collaboration

CEO of MLH, Mike Swift, points to the program‚Äôs design around remote work and public projects:

&gt; Enabling students to spend their summer contributing to the software that runs the world is a unique     opportunity for them. They‚Äôll work on meaningful projects with their peers under the guidance of some of the world‚Äôs most talented engineers. The remote nature of this program will democratize access to internships for countless students worldwide.

###### The opportunity: Shape the future of work
In this moment, companies have the opportunity to affect how we learn, collaborate, and share for decades to come. We hope to see the results of these particular efforts in as little as 12 months when this year‚Äôs group of interns graduate.

&gt; Let‚Äôs keep education moving forward. Students, we got you. - GitHub

The company has made big changes to its XPS lineup, with the much-rumored redesign of the XPS 15 and a new XPS 17.
What do these laptops bring to the market let's find in this article?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dell/dell-xps-15-17.jpeg)

Lets first talk about the XPS 15, The new XPS 15 design has seen a significant redesign after nearly 5 years and it now comes with a bigger 16:10 aspect ratio and trimmed down bezels, similar to that of Dell XPS 13.
You can either pick a 4k or a regular FHD (1920 x 1200) display with a small webcam on top for Windows 10 Hello Facial Recognition. It also offers a fingerprint for authentication.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dell/dell-xps-15-17-display.jpeg)

+ Powering this is the new 10th gen mobile processors from Intel which can be equipped up to a Core i9 and it also comes with an option for dedicated graphics namely the  Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q for graphically intense task.

+ This laptop ditches ports like USB-A and HDMI in favor of USB-C and this laptop comes with two USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 support and a regular USB-C 3.1 port, and full-size SD card reader. This laptop is quite thinner at 18mm high.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dell/dell-xps-15-17-ports.jpg)

+ Talking about battery, Dell is promising ‚ÄúThe longest battery life of any 15-inch laptop‚Äù, with up to 25 hours on the FHD display model and It also comes with Quad speaker setup(2 front facing and 2 at rear) for immersive sound experience. 

This laptop starts at **$1,299.99**.

Alongside the XPS 15, Dell reintroduced it's slightly bigger XPS 17. It‚Äôs been nearly 10 years since we have seen an XPS 17 and as the name implies it's a larger 17-inch laptop and dell claims that ‚ÄúThe XPS 17 is the smallest 17-inch laptop on the planet‚Äù. 
Similar to the XPS 15 this laptop also comes with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a much smaller bezel.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dell/dell-xps-15-17-17.jpeg)

This 17-inch laptop also comes new 10th gen intel processors, which can be equipped up to the new core i9 and at the GPU side of things, this can be equipped with either Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q or the more powerful RTX 2060. With this CPU and GPU combination Dell claims this laptop to be the &quot;Most powerful XPS laptop ever&quot;.

+ Talking about the ports, this comes with four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and a full-size SD card reader and the fact that it does not have any USB-A port is a bummer. 
+ Dell has added a new thermal design to the XPS 17 with a custom vapor chamber, to improve airflow and sustain high performance for longer periods of time.
+ It also comes with Quad speaker setup(2 front facing and 2 at rear) for immersive sound experience.
