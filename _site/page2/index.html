PUBG is developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. It was first developed for PC’s.  In part of the game’s success in early access, Tencent Games, the largest publisher of video games in China, approached Bluehole with an offer to publish Battlegrounds in China and purchase equity in the company.  Following the Chinese publication deal for the Windows version, Tencent Games and PUBG Corporation additionally announced that they were planning on releasing two mobile versions based on the game. Confusion check:: PUBG was banned in China in 2017(as it has violence, so their government banned). This instigated Tencent Games, the video game publishing unit of Tencent Hodings, a Chinese company to secure the rights of distribution in China. It also planned on developing a mobile version of the game, and PUBG Mobile came into existence. Now, this is where it gets tricky. Until then, PUBG was a video game. It was Tencent Games who made a mobile version of PUBG and released it in China. This is the reason why you can see the Tencent Games logo as soon as you open the game, followed by PUBG Corporation.

    "body": "2020/06/23 - Apple’s home screen hasn’t changed much since the launch of it’s first iphone. The new operating system brings a redesigned home screen and much-needed features to catch up with what Android has to offer.  App Library:This feature allows us to access and organize our apps much easier by creating a new space called the App library at the end of the home screen pages. It creates folders based on the type of apps and even has a separate folder for frequently used apps. It even has the option to hide pages, which you don’t use.  Improved Widgets:Anything we miss when we switch from Android to iOS is a lack of widgets on the home screen. This feature now lets you do just that, not only that you can even resize your widgets according to your wish. This even has a widget gallery, which contains all the available widgets available for a particular app. There’s also a new “Smart Stack” widget that automatically shows relevant apps based on the time of day.  Picture - In- Picture Mode for Videos:Apple finally added system-wide picture-in-picture mode to iOS 14, which basically lets you hover over apps and adjust in size and you can even collapse into the side of the display to continue playing in the background.  Siri:The most annoying thing when you call for Siri is that it takes up the whole screen and Apple addresses this problem with the introduction of a new compact design, there’s just a small animated Siri icon at the bottom. Siri can now take answers from the website. Siri can now help send audio messages in addition to just dictated messages.  Translate App:Apple also introduced a new Translate app that will come built-in with iOS 14. It will allow users to easily translate between languages. Users will be able to enter text in or dictate messages and have them translated into 11 languages. English, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian will all be supported at launch and the fact that it is available offline makes it even more useful.  Messages:Messages are also getting new features in iOS 14, now you will be able to pin important conversations to the top of the Message app to easily talk to your favorite friends or group chats. There is also 20 new hairstyle and even mask option and even ages options for memojis and there is also an option for groups inline replies, which helps to keep track of the conversations happening in the groups.  Apple Maps:Apple Maps is getting new, curated guides from companies like Zagat or AllTrails to give better recommendations for new places. Maps is also giving a new option for cycling, with dedicated directions for bike-riding. Cycling will launch in NYC, LA, San Fransisco’s Bay Area, Shanghai, and Beijing. There is also a new EV Routing feature, which will track the current charge of your car and route you to compatible stations.  CarPlay and Carkeys:CarPlay is getting support for custom wallpapers and new app categories: parking apps, EV chargers, and fast food takeout apps. CarKeys will let you leave your keys at home and use your iPhone as a key to lock/unlock your car. You can even share the hey using messages app and you can even apply a restricted driving profile. This feature will not only be an iOS 14 exclusive but will be supported iniOS 13 as well. The 2021 BMW 5 Series will be the first car to come with support for car keys.  AppClips:AppClips will let users access a small part of the app that you need without downloading the app. The new feature is meant to help users have quick access to the app. When you scan a QR code, a dedicated App Clip code or NFC tags, your iPhone will launch the App Clip card. You can tap Open to launch the app without downloading it. App Clips are compatible with Apple Pay and Sign in with Apple. This means you don’t have to make an account with an app or use your credit card information. Users will be able to pay for takeout, parking, and learn more about local businesses just by scanning. iOS 14 will be out this fall, but a developer preview will be available to Apple Developer Program members starting today, with plans for a public beta for all iOS users in July. iOS 14 will work on the iPhone 6S and up — the same devices that supported iOS 13.

These are some products Xiaomi launched in China recently. Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset Pro:: Xiaomi has been doing well when it comes to wireless headsets and to add up in this line up the company launched a new TWS called the Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset Pro.

Mi Laser Projector 1S 4K:: Xiaomi, also launched a projector called the Mi Laser Projector 1S 4K.  The highlight of this projector has to be the fact that it can use short-focus that allows the device to cast from 80 inches and up to 150 inches from just a few centimeters away and the company claims that an 80-inch screen can be cast when the projector is placed just 5. 5-inch away and for the maximum 150-inch display, the projector needs to be placed at a distance of at least 19 inches, which is of great convenience.

The projector is priced at 12,999 yuan which roughly converts to 139391. 36 Rupees. Xiaomi Mi Power Bank 3:: The Mi Power Bank 3 is the largest power bank released by the company till date.

    "title": "BBK Electronics: The real mastermind behind Oppo, Vivo, One Plus, Realme and iQOO",
    "body": "2020/06/19 - By now, most of you might know that Oppo, Vivo, One Plus, Realme, and recently iQOO are owned by a single company called BBK Electronics. So why own multiple brands in the same industry?. To understand the real reason behind it we need to look at their history. The Foundation of BBK:: The founder Yong Ping Duan used to work in Subor Electronics which sold Consumer electronics like learning machines, language repeaters, electronic dictionary, reading machines, and several other products. Thereafter in 1995 stared his own company called BBK Electronics. This company also sold Consumer electronics and then further expanded into making DVD player,mp3 player, feature phone, and many more. The Birth of Oppo:: This was the time when sales of BBK products started reducing and the idea to overcome the challenge was to create a subsidiary brand and this gave birth to Oppo. The brand name Oppo registered in 2001 in China and launched in 2004. Tony Chen was appointed as the CEO of the company. Oppo started making several products like DVD player,mp3 player, feature phone. The first product that they sold was OPPO OPDV971H, which was a Universal DVD player. The company entered the smartphone market in the year 2008 and just within five years it became the second most profitable company in China among other players like ZTE, Huawei, Lenovo, and Xiaomi in 2013. The brand started it’s international expansion in 2010 with Thailand, where it announced Find 3 and then later showcased the Find 5, which was followed by Find 7. It also started expanding its presence in other countries like Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many more countries. The Company’s main advantage was that it operated locally in the regions and tried to understand the customer needs and make products accordingly. Speaking about the Indian market, at the time when Oppo entered the smartphone market in 2014, the market was just starting to grow and Oppo mainly used its advertising strategies to sell their phones and their Ad campaigns had a lot of emphasis on the selfie camera and now Oppo is a major player in the Indian smartphone market. The Birth of Vivo:: Did you know that most of your favourite car companies such as Lamborghini, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, and many other car companies belong to Volkswagen? BBK also wanted to imply something like this which ended up giving birth to another sub-branded arm of the BBK Electronics called Vivo and this was founded in 2009 and Shen Wei was appointed as CEO. The company designs, develops, and manufactures smartphones, accessories, software, and online services. The brand is known for it’s High Fidelity audio experience. It’s a hardware-level technology that the company integrates in their handsets, started with at the time world’s slimmest smartphone, the X1, launched in 2012. The company not only works on hardware, but develops intuitive interactive systems connecting its users and phone, Thus, you can see that brand has their own customized Android-based operating system called Funtouch OS, which offers a range of smart features such as Smart Click, Super Screenshot, Single-handed mode and various other smart features on their handsets. Speaking of Indian presence, the company launched its first smartphone in India in December 2014 with the world’s slimmest smartphone at the time, the X5Max, which was priced quite premium around Rs 32,000. The company within two years has to spread into different segments like the X, Y, and V Series, and now it’s one of the top five smartphone brands in India. The Birth of OnePlus:: This was the time when Xioami, which most of the people know as Mi was completely disrupting the smartphone market by selling good and cheap smartphone online, this made Oppo release a new subsidiary brand in the year 2013 and named it OnePlus. Pete Lau Carl Pei was appointed as the CEO of One Plus. OnePlus followed the same strategy of selling phones online for cheaper price will Oppo and Vivo focus on the Offline market. The company launched its first smartphone OnePlus One in the year 2014, which came with Cyanogen OS based on android was a big hit, it managed to offer flagship specs at a much lower price, but later it could not use Cyanogen in India because Micromax had a deal in which only their phones could use Cyanogen this lead to the creation of one of the best skins loved by so many people called the Oxygen Os. After the success of one plus 1 and 2, which were flagship killers, One plus wanted to make a mid-ranger phone called the OnePlus X in 2015, but that did not get much love. It later focused on Flagship Killer and even recently started making Flagship phones and it became number one in the premium market of India. The birth of Realme:: While OnePlus occupied the premium market, Xioami has entirely conquered the Indian mid-range smartphone market and became the number one smartphone manufacture beating the then-leader Samsung. This gave birth to another subsidiary company called Realme, you might wonder, why not just have OnePlus launch a mid-range phone, after all, they were supposed to be the bang for buck smartphone brand for Oppo but OnePlus is not a budget smartphone brand anymore as they have slowly increased the price and they don’t want to be seen as budget smartphone maker anymore. Coming back to Realme, this was founded in 2018 and Sky Li was appointed as CEO. It entered the Indian market with the Realme 1, which gave an instant hit to the company and from there they grew and now become the number four smartphone seller in India. The company further expanded into Europe and many other countries. This company main focus was to compete with Xioami, which they have been doing successfully. The Birth of iQOO:: BBK saw the rise in the market for a gaming smartphone and wanted to get into the market this gave birth to the brand iQOO which is Vivo’s subsidiary brand and Gagan Arora was appointed as CEO. iQOO entered the Chinese smartphone market in 2019 and Indian market in the year 2020 with the introduction with the iQOO 3 and that phone did great for the company and will be a tough competition to the remaining gaming brands and we will be exciting to see how this company turns out in the future. Note: The fact that there are some other companies that BBK Electronics in smartphones and other electronic companies, the above were some of the game changers for BBK Electronics. So why Own multiple brands?: Now to the main question why does BBK own so many subsidiary brands in the same sector? Given below are three main reasons.    Since you have read the above you might have already understood the fact that all these sub-brands focus at different types of customers. OnePlus focuses on those power users whose priority is speed and to get top of the line specs, while Realme mainly focuses on those people who want value smartphones and they try to offer the best value possible. Oppo and Vivo focus on offline market and camera-centric phones. iQOO aims on people whose highest priority is gaming. With this distribution of brands, they can offer different smartphones at different price points which helps them to easily conquer the entire market.     If one company experiences a negative reputation, remaining will not be affected. For Ex: Maggi recently got a bad name because of objective levels of metallic lead found in it, but this did not affect the parent company nestle or it’s other sub-brands.     Sharing of resources, since all the companies belong to the same parent company they can share their R&amp;D, factory chains, and many other things. For Example, OnePlus and Oppo, where OnePlus uses Oppo fast charging tech-Vooc technology and when you look at OnePLus phone’s they share the same design to Oppo’s phones, when you look carefully, the OnePlus One and Oppo Find 7a, you can find a lot of similarities.

Along with bigger display comes new faces 100 to be precise and these wallpaper will also have some renowned animated series, including Hatsune Miku, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and SpongeBob SquarePants. These can be found on the Mi Fit app. More Sport Tracking:: This new Mi Band 5 has also increased the number of sport activities that the Mi band could record.

The six new modes-indoor running, indoor cycling, elliptical machine, skipping rope, yoga, and rowing machine.

It also comes with stress monitoring and breathing exercises built into the band. It comes with improved sleep tracking. The band also has a dedicated women health Tracking which will help them track their period cycles, ovulation period, and more. New Charging Method:: If you have used any of the old Mi band then you will know how hard is it to charge the Mi Band, Xiaomi solves this bring a new magnetic charger that charges which sticks to the Mi Band and charge it up with the help of contact pins.

    "body": "2020/06/17 - We have seen Qualcomm forcing manufactures to include 5G with the latest flagship Snapdragon 865, by not selling a separate version a separate 865 without 5G. We have also seen the company include its 5G modem(X51 modem) to the 700 series chips with SnapDragon 765 5G and now Qualcomm has decided to add the 5G modem to 600 series of chipset with the introduction of SnapDragon 690 processor. This new Snapdragon 690 is an 8nm processor, which will be a successor to Snapdragon 675. The processor will come Kryo 560 CPU and Adreno 619L GPU, which will offer 20 percent better CPU performance and 60 percent faster graphics rendering compared to the Snapdragon 675. It will also have support for high-end features like support 120Hz displays for faster refresh rates, 4K HDR video capture, and up to 192-megapixel camera sensor support. Speaking of connectivity, It will have support for Wifi standard like Wifi 6, Wifi 5, and Wifi 2. 4GHZ and it will come with Bluetooth 5. 1 support as well.

Here are the complete specs released by snapdragon - The 5G modem in this will only support slower sub-6GHz versions of 5G, not the faster mmWave standard. This 5G modem in this chipset will allow for a wider adoption of this technology. We can see 5G enabled smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 690 in the year 2021 at a price point of 10,000 to 20,000 rupees.

The folks at XDA Developer have spotted several references about the TWS(‘true wireless stereo’) in the Android 11 beta code. This TWS can be named as One Plus Pods, but at this point, we are a bit skeptical. There is also mention of ‘oppoPodsService’ in the code, which can mean that the companies will be sharing the technologies and we can expect to see some hardware lend from the Oppo Enco Free or the Enco W31. We can expect to see this product getting launched in two to three months alongside the One Plus’s mid-range phone One Plus Z. "

It is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back. This phone comes with dual punch-hole cutouts to accommodate two cameras. Speaking of display it comes with 120Hz IPS LCD panel, 120 Hz is good but would have loved to see Amoled instead of the IPS LCD. Internals and software:: Speaking of internals, It comes with the previous year’s flagship processor from Qualcomm-Snapdragon 855 plus, which still is quite fast. It will come with the option to spec the phone up to 12 GB RAM and 256 GB internal storage. It will not support 5G but it will come with Bluetooth 5. 0, GPS, and others for connectivity. Speaking of battery capacity, This phone will have 4200 mAh and a 30W charger for fast charging. Speaking of Software, It comes with Realme UI based on Android 10 running the show.

    "body": "2020/06/16 - Moto after being acquired by Lenovo has not been able to release a good mid-range smartphone but this phone might be the one to change this. Let’s see what this phone has offer. Design and Display:: Talking about the design, It’s a plastic build phone with a notch-less design on the front. The screen is IPS LCD with a size 6. 5 inch. It’s an FHD screen with 1,080x2,340 resolution and a refresh rate of 60Hz. We would have loved to see either a higher refresh or an AMOLED screen. Internals and software:: Speaking of internals, it is powered by the Qualcomm-Snapdragon 730G which is coupled by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage and you can also expand the storage up to a 1TB using the Hybrid sim slot. It also comes with Bluetooth v5, Wi-Fi 802. 11ac, GPS, 3. 5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and Dual 4G VoLTE for connectivity.  Speaking of software, It’s My UX running on top of Android 10, which is almost a stock Android-like experience with a few additional tweaks to enhance the user experience. Camera:: This phone comes with a Quad-Rear camera setup, The primary camera being a 64 MP lens. The second sensor and the highlight of the phone is the 8MP wide-angle lens. The third is a 5MP Macro lens and the last one is a 2MP depth sensor. Speaking of selfie camera, we have a 16MP sensor. Pricing and Verdict:: Moto decided to price the 6G RAM and 128GB ROM at 16,999, At this price, this is competing against the likes of Realme 6, Realme X2, Samsung M31, Vivo Z1x, Redmi Note 9 Pro and Pro Max. We think it’s a good smartphone, if what you what is a stock android like experience and a full-screen notch-less display this might suit you the best.

First, let’s talk about faster charging, One Plus is reportedly bringing 65W fast charging to its 8t series of smartphone line up and this was found in the android 11 code. This is not something new we have already seen this tech being used in other phones from Oppo’s Find X2 Pro and Realme’s X50 Pro. This speed will be achieved by using a dual-cell battery, both of which charge individually. This will be a considerable setup compared to the Warp Charge 30T found on the One Plus 8 and 8 pro. Here you can see the code reveals the new colors and 65W fast charging support. Code:&lt;string name= swrap_charger_test &gt;Super Wrap Charger&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name= fastcharger_swrap &gt;65W Fast Charge&lt;/string&gt;In the Android 11 code found in the latest one Plus phone there is a list of all the color variants of the One Plus 8 series, but it also includes a new color called the Ice Blue color, It can either be the color of the same One Plus 8 series or it might be a special edition phone, Only time has the answer.

    "body": "2020/06/15 - Google, has been trying to keep privacy as one of its key goals and we can find hints of it in the Android 11 Beta, In which Google has removed the option for allowing apps to take data from phones always.  In the decompiled latest version of the Files by Google, 9TO5Google was able to find this feature. They found that they have added a new feature called the Safe folder, where users can safely hide their files and keeps them from being accessed by other apps or by anyone other than you who has access to your phone. The authentication for this will be done by Pin. We think Google might end up adding fingerprint and face unlock before the official release of this feature. If you see the code below, we cannot find any built-in methods to recover password, If you happen to forget the password, while nothing states that your files are being encrypted, the fact that Files by Google can’t recover the files or password strongly suggests encryption is involved. Below is the code found by 9TO5Google. &lt;string name=”safe_folder_label”&gt;Safe folder&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”safe_folder_first_time_tooltip”&gt;Move any files you want to keep protected by a PIN to this folder. &lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”safe_folder_after_setup_tooltip”&gt;Find your protected files in this folder. &lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”remember_your_password_warning_title”&gt;Remember your password&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”remember_your_password_warning_description”&gt;”Safe folder can’t be opened again if you forget the password. ”&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”remember_your_password_warning_button”&gt;Got it&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”move_into_safe_folder_menu_text”&gt;Move to Safe folder&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”move_out_of_safe_folder_menu_text”&gt;Move out of Safe folder&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=”confirm_pin_to_move_title”&gt;Confirm PIN to move&lt;/string&gt;No surprise to see Google to make such a move since most of the users are losing confidence from Google in terms of privacy, Samsung has been offering the same feature for years in their phone and called it Secure Folder. We don’t recommend you to try this feature now as the PIN recovery is not there and as it is in testing stage. source: 9t05google Images: XDA "

    "body": "2020/06/14 - Hi Folks, Before you download our collection of wallpapers, let us explain why these are special and beauty of AMOLED screen. AMOLED stands for Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode and it is also used for televisions screens but more notably, for smartphones. OLED displays are similar, but do not use an Active Matrix. Why AMOLED is special?: The screen is made up of organic material that actually produces light when a current is passed through it – electroluminescence. AMOLED displays are easier on your battery because every pixel is not always lit up. They also show true blacks because there is no back-lighting. Does this save battery?: If you have an AMOLED display then you can save some battery life by using black wallpapers, or generally darker wallpapers and themes. People at XDA Developers did a little experiment and figured out that you can save about 6 percent battery life per hour at 20 percent brightness by using a black wallpaper on an AMOLED display, and about 8 percent per hour at full brightness. Download our collection of wallpapers: To download a AMOLED wallpapers for your smartphone background, click here You can also set a darker system-wide theme for your device and don’t forget to change your app themes to be as dark as possible to enhance the battery-saving effects.

    "body": "2020/06/12 - Sony has been a major player in the console market for years and they finally revealed what its next-generation console looks like, the several other accessories to go with, and also some important features in the game show today. Speaking of the PlayStation 5, this time it comes in two variants one is the Standard PlayStation 5 and the other is the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition. The difference being that the Digital Edition does not have a disk drive. We can expect at least a 100$(7500 rupees) price difference between the two variants. The standard edition’s disk drive supports 4K Blu-ray drive which was missing on the PS4. Looks and Design:: Talking about the looks and design, we think the two-tone design of the PS5, which is the black surrounded by white design looks futuristic but we can find a lot of people on the internet saying that it looks like a router and we won’t cannot deny that even. On the front of the PS5 we get a regular USB and a USB-c port, the I/O on the back is kind of a mystery for now and we can find an air went on the top. Accessories:: The PS5 is accompanied by several other accessories, which sony showed on the event. The first being the Dual Sense Controller which also comes with the dual-tone finish similar to that of the PlayStation. We also find the Dual-Sense Stand to charge two controllers at once and that looks pretty cool. For all those how to remember the pulse wireless gaming headset which sony came out years ago, The successor of that the Pulse 3D wireless is here and that looks minimal with the two-tone design and promises to offer a fully immersive sound experience. It also comes with an HD camera following a similar two-tone vibe. PS5 standard edition will also come with a remote to use your PS5 as a regular Blu-ray player.  Specs:: Taking about some feature which we know so far, It will be coming with a proprietary SSD to reduce the load times. The console will be powered by eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and a custom AMD RDNA 2-based GPU. This CPU and GPU will support 8K graphics, 4K graphics at a 120Hz refresh rate, and 3D audio. It will also have Ray tracing support. Sony also previously said that it will support backward compatibility for some games, how many and which games only time has the answer.

Today the company has launched two laptops which include Mi Notebook 14 and Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition.       Name   Specifications         Display   14-inch Anti-glare FHD (1920x1080)       CPU   10th-gen Intel Core i7-10510U and i5-10210U(Comet Lake)       GPU   NVIDIA GeForce MX350       RAM   8GB DDR4 (2666MHz)       Storage   512GB NVME M. 2 SSD       Connectivity   2x2 Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5. 0       Ports   HDMI 1. 4b, USB 3. 1 (x2), USB 2. 0, USB-C       Audio   2 x 2W speakers, 3. 5mm jack       Battery   46Wh and 65W fast charger       Weight   1. 35kg   Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition:: Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition comes with an all-metal design made of aluminum and magnesium alloy and weighs just 1. 35 kgs. Taking about the design, We think it looks classy with no branding on the outside. Talking about Biometric unlock, It does not come with any biometric unlock like the fingerprint or the face unlock, hell it doesn’t even have a webcam built-in but at least they bundle an external HD webcam in the box. One thing about the Mi Laptop that will stand out to you is the almost bezel-less anti-glare LCD with a screen to body ratio of 91 percent. It is a 14 inch IPS LCD display with bezels as thin as 3mm at the top and around the sides, as per the press release. The bottom bezel is slightly thicker to accommodate the Mi logo. It comes with 16:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. The panels comes with a 178-degree viewing angle and can go up to a peak brightness of 250 nits.  Talking about Internals, The laptop is powered by the 10th-Gen Intel Core Comet Lake processor, You can either equip this with an i5-10210u or a much powerful i7-10510u. It is coupled with a with 8GB of DDR4 RAM and up to 512GB SSD storage. On the graphical side of things, it comes with a dedicated graphics card namely the Nvidia GeForce MX350 (2GB). This card can handle some casual gaming and also some light video editing. This laptop comes with a chiclet keyboard (no Numpad) with 1. 3mm key travel and a fairly modest-size multi-touch trackpad and it also has a single fan for cooling. Talking about ports, You get a single USB 2. 0 port and 3. 5mm audio jack on the left. The right edge includes two USB 3. 1, one HDMI 1. 4b, and one USB Type-C port. You also get WiFi 802. 11ac (WiFi 5, 2 x 2) and Bluetooth 5. 0 as the wireless connectivity.  Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition comes with a 46Wh battery, which the company says should last you up to 10 hours on a single charge. It also comes with a 65W fast charger which the company says can juice up your battery from 0 to 50% in just around 30 minutes, which is quite impressive. Talking about the software, It comes with windows 10 home edition on board and no much bloatware, the only apps we have are some mi utility apps like Mi Smart Share for faster file sharing , Blaze Unlock for unlocking the laptop using a Mi Band and it also has the DTS app for better sound experience. Mi Notebook 14:: The standard Mi Notebook 14 has some considerable differences – both on the design and internals front. This laptop is a rebranded version of the RedmiBook 14 Pro, which debuted in China back last year. The main differentiator is that it comes with a much thicker bezels when compared to the horizon edition but the panel is the same 14-inch Full-HD display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 178-degree viewing angle, and 250 nits of peak brightness. Even though the bezels are thicker but still it doesn’t have a built-in webcam, but at least they bundle an external HD webcam in the box. Speaking of internals, You only comes with an i5 processor in this variant and it is coupled with 8GB 2666MHz RAM and up to 512GB SATA 3 SSD onboard. The graphic card is also changed it comes with an Nvidia GeForce MX250 instead of the MX350. The ports, connectivity, battery, and other software feature are similar to that of the Horizon Edition.

To check if your email address has been exposed, first you need to visit Firefox Monitor’s website. Then type in the email address and click on “Check for Breaches”.  If your Email ID is comparatively new, chances are you’re safe and not been exposed to any data breaches. However, if your email ID is old, you might find a similar result as I have. This means that my ID was exposed to seven data breaches since 2007. Have I Been Pwned?: Have I Been Pwned is a website developed by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft Regional Director after the largest ever single breach of customer accounts — Adobe. The primary purpose of this site is to serve the public. Data breaches are rampant and many people don’t appreciate the scale or frequency with which they occur. By aggregating the data here I hope that it not only helps victims learn of compromises of their accounts, but also highlights the severity of the risks of online attacks on today’s internet. To check whether your data is breached, firstly open Have I Been Pwned site. Then enter your email address.  Then the site will display how many and what are all the breaches your email address have been part of Closing Words: Like I said at the start, no data is safe. As all the three services tell you about the breach after the breach is over, your credentials are out in the open. However, you can always take care of a few things, like changing your password frequently, avoid using the same or similar passwords, creating strong passwords, and also, enabling two-step verification or using Official Account Authenticator Apps wherever supported.

    "title": "What is the difference between Scholarship and Fellowship?",
    "body": "2020/06/01 - Both scholarship and fellowship in general assume a financial aid for students and researchers, or any individual with an interest to search, find and research something new. Scholarships and fellowships are instituted by a University, a research center, academic institution, laboratory, government or a foundation. Main difference between Scholarship and Fellowship: The most important difference between scholarship and fellowship is that the term scholarship always means that there is a financial aid available. So there is no scholarship without financial aid. If there is scholarship, then a financial aid is included as a tuition fee, as a per diem, as a living allowance or in any other shape, but there is always money included. In case of fellowship, though in most cases a financial aid will be provided, but the term does not necessarily suppose a financial aid. For example, if someone receives a scholarship to study at Ohio University or to do a research at NASA that means the person has for sure received money to study or to do a research. When MIT or Harvard announce scholarships for undergraduate, graduate or postgraduate students, for researchers or journalists, that always means the University or research institute or the foundation is going to fully or partly cover some of the costs. But the fellowship first of all is the status, only then a financial aid. Fellowship is a status within the University or research institute and it may or may not include a financial aid. Cambridge or Oxford sometimes announce a fellowship and only provide a desk with a computer at the library. For that particular position often apply many renowned researchers or public figures, who are ready to pay for all other costs themselves, only to receive the announced fellowship. Fellowship may be granted as a status within an academic institution and that’s it, nothing more, no salary (sometimes with salary), no financial aid, just status. With that status the person may be accepted as a fellow of certain college or department and have access to some of library and research facilities. Other differences between scholarships and fellowships: Scholarships are available from the very early stage of academic career. Even before University career and undergraduate studies one may apply for a scholarship in the school, but no fellowships are available for that stage. The same is true for undergraduate studies. All financial aid available for undergraduate students in the University is called scholarship and only in rare cases, when related to research activities it may be called fellowship. From graduate level financial aid, which is called a fellowship may be available for students who are particularly interested in some specific research area. Scholarships are granted to student level and above, and the fellowships are mainly for experienced individuals to apply. For example, if you search google for scholarships for journalists you will mainly get results about financial aid to study in the University at any level, but if you search fellowships for journalists you will get first of all results about programs for experienced journalists to conduct some investigations and do some research. In many instances scholarship and fellowship are used interchangeably, cause some confusion, and sometime mean the same thing or something different. Hopefully this short introduction about the differences of scholarship and fellowship is helpful. Share your feedback on twitter, Instagram, or mail us at support@devskrate. com.

This smart tv comes in two sizes the 32 and the 43-inch. The main differentiator apart from size is that the 32 inch comes with an HD screen whereas the 43-inch comes with a full HD, while the rest of the specifications remain the same.

    "body": "2020/05/24 - Deno is the creation of Ryan Dahl, which is a new JavaScript runtime for the backend, but instead of being written in C++, it’s written in Rust, based on the Tokio platform (which provides the asynchronous runtime needed by JavaScript), running on Google’s V8 engine. It is also a new runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser. Why should we use this?: Generally we may get a doubt, why should I use it, here are some of it’s features. They are: 1. Security is integratedNode. js allows you to access read and write into the filesystem, access environment variables, make outgoing requests, etc. As well as it also opens up a security risk if you are not careful when writing code. So instead, Deno uses command-line arguments to enable or disable access to different security features. So if you need your script to be able to access the /etc folder, you can do: deno --allow-read=/etc myscript. tsIt will allow your code to read from the folder, anything else and you’ll get a security exception. This is similar to how other platforms handle security. 2. Complete standard libraryDeno claims to have a complete standard library allowing developers to use official tools to perform basic tasks and only requiring the use of external libraries for complex tasks and it comes with the tools to add color to terminal text, generate UUIDs, work with external data structures, and for writing WebSockets. 3. Integrated TypescriptIn Deno, by default the integration into JavaScript is done internally, so no need for external tooling. By default Deno takes care of a lot, you can overwrite the configuration by using your own tsconfig. json file: deno run -c tsconfig. json [your-script. ts]The default configuration of Deno is to use strict mode, so any ill-advised coding practice will be alerted immediately. Deno Installation: Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below: Using Shell (macOS, Linux):$ curl -fsSL https://deno. land/x/install/install. sh | shUsing PowerShell (Windows):$ iwr https://deno. land/x/install/install. ps1 -useb | iexUsing Cargo (Windows, macOS, Linux):$ cargo install denoUsing Homebrew (macOS):$ brew install denoUsing Chocolatey (Windows):$ choco install denoUsing Scoop (Windows):$ scoop install denoWhere to learn Deno?: https://www. freecodecamp. org/news/the-deno-handbook/ About author:: Akash rao Mallareddy - Web Developer, StartUp Enthusiastic, Leader      Follow him on Linkedin, Github, Twitter "

    "title": "Microsoft Teams vs Slack:The Battle of collaborative work",
    "body": "2020/05/23 - Both Microsoft Teams and Slack are collaboration platform tools that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration. Back then, Slack began as an internal tool for Stewart Butterfield’s company Tiny Speck during the development of Glitch, an online game. Then Slack was launched in August 2013.  In 2016, Satya Nadella and Bill Gates met up to discuss an important matter. They wanted to bid 8 billion USD to acquire Slack, the SaaS giant that dominated the team chat app space. The meeting had a surprising conclusion: instead of buying Slack, they decided to build their own team chat app tool. In November 2016, Microsoft Teams was officially launched.  And now, both Teams and Slack had gained a good amount of daily active users. Choosing between Slack and Microsoft Teams for your next collaboration tool? Here’s what you need to know about the differences between the two, so you can choose the platform that best suits the needs of your team. : Talking about features, there is a large difference in both of then. They’re           Slack   Microsoft Teams         Pricing model   Freemium Standard $6. 67 user/month (billed annually) Plus $12. 50 user/month (billed annually)   Freemium Office 365 Business Essentials $5 per user/month(billed annually) $12. 50 per user/month(billed annually) You can try both paid plans for free for 30 days       Message history limit   10K messages in Free plan, unlimited in Standard and Plus plans   Unlimited in all plans       Audio/video calls   Unlimited 1:1 voice and video calls in Free plan Conference calls for up to 15 participants in Paid plans   Voice/video calls with up to 250 people in a meeting.        Integrations   10 integrations limit in Free plan, 800+ integrations in paid plans   180+ apps and services (as of July 2018)       File storage limit   Free plan: 5GB file storage for a team Standard plan: 10GB per user Plus plan: 20GB per user   Free plan: 2 GB/user and 10GB of shared storage Paid plans: 1 TB per organization       Screen sharing   Unavailable in Free version, available in Standard and Plus versions   Available in all plans       Interface color options   Custom sidebar themes.    3 themes (light, dark, high contrast)       Conversation threads   Yes   Yes   Microsoft Teams integrations vs Slack integrations: Microsoft Teams and Slack take slightly different approaches to integration with other apps. Slack integrations: Slack boasts a ton of integrations with a variety of different apps—more than 800 for paid plans, to be exact. The sheer number and variety of apps available means that you can customize your Slack workspace to make your workflow seamless. Microsoft Teams integrations: While Slack offers more options for customization, Microsoft Teams takes a different approach—offering a full-fledged collaboration platform with many different functionalities built in from day one. Essentially, Teams isn’t meant to be a standalone tool. It’s a fully integrated Office 365 collaboration hub, allowing users to move seamlessly between tasks and apps within the Teams window.  Wrapping up: Here are some of our conclusions regarding Slack vs. Microsoft Teams. Pricing: Both Teams and Slack have freemium plans. When it comes to the paid plans, the cheapest Microsoft Teams plan is less expensive than Slack’s cheapest plan. MT wins this roound. Layout and design: The layout in Microsoft Teams has far too many tabs. On the other hand, there is less to see immediately in Slack because they want to improve their user interface. Moreover, Slack has more options to customize the app’s look. Messaging: Both Teams and Slack have different ways to send and receive messages, including threads. Microsoft Teams has more built-in options to format your text, and in return, Slack lets you set reminders for individual messages. File sharing and collaboration: Microsoft Teams lets you share Office files and work on them immediately from the workspace. Slack doesn’t come with the option of editing documents from the workspace, so you have to download files and open them in specific apps to edit them. Video calls: Both apps allow video calls and the feature works very well. However, Teams has a built-in video recording feature, which is really neat. Moreover, MT allows up to 250 people in a single call when you’re on a paid plan, compared to Slack which allows 15 people at a time. Integrations: While Microsoft Teams has excellent native integrations with Office and some third-party app integrations, Slack definitely wins in this department – it has more than 800 integrations that you can use. Summary: Both apps are a good choice but they are catered for different needs. If you want lots of third-party integrations and the ability to customize your app to a great extent go with Slack. On the other hand, Microsoft Teams works really well for companies that do a lot of work Office 365 and who already pay for that service. If you are planning to use free version, then Microsoft Teams would suit you the best because, there are are a lot more features in Microsoft Teams than Slack. May be this is the reason why, Microsoft Teams had a larger user base. "

With the culture shift that comes along with remote work, it’s fair to say that collaboration is already starting to be different. GitHub Education, always helps the next generation of developers to make their best in work. Now, more than ever, students need opportunities to sustain their growth. Github together with their partners Major League Hacking (MLH), solving this problem with a new program—the MLH Fellowship, Powered by GitHub. This remote program matches up pods of 8-10 students with open-source projects and mentors over a period of 12 weeks. Students will receive a stipend for the program through GitHub Sponsors.  Not just GitHub, many other tech companies will come together and fuel this ecosystem. To kick off the program, GitHub Education plans to support 100 MLH Fellows in the inaugural class of summer 2020. These are the other partners who’re joining this coalition Facebook, DEV, and the Royal Bank of Canada. This is how GitHub describes about MLH Fellowship GitHub’s vision: Workforce innovation to meet student demandEnterprises want to stay competitive with recent graduates, and internship programs often provide that edge. Internships also serve as a credential: For future hiring managers, an internship with a top tech company is a good indication of a quality candidate. But for students, many, many more of them apply for those coveted roles than there are positions to fill. For most students, a summer in Silicon Valley is often out of the question for those aspiring developers, maintainers, and engineering managers. In partnering with MLH, we’re looking to welcome a new global workforce that is trained in real-world workflows and collaboration CEO of MLH, Mike Swift, points to the program’s design around remote work and public projects:  Enabling students to spend their summer contributing to the software that runs the world is a unique   opportunity for them. They’ll work on meaningful projects with their peers under the guidance of some of the world’s most talented engineers. The remote nature of this program will democratize access to internships for countless students worldwide. The opportunity: Shape the future of workIn this moment, companies have the opportunity to affect how we learn, collaborate, and share for decades to come. We hope to see the results of these particular efforts in as little as 12 months when this year’s group of interns graduate.  Let’s keep education moving forward.

With this CPU and GPU combination Dell claims this laptop to be the “Most powerful XPS laptop ever”.  Talking about the ports, this comes with four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and a full-size SD card reader and the fact that it does not have any USB-A port is a bummer.  Dell has added a new thermal design to the XPS 17 with a custom vapor chamber, to improve airflow and sustain high performance for longer periods of time.  It also comes with Quad speaker setup(2 front facing and 2 at rear) for immersive sound experience. The new Dell XPS 17 will be available soon starting at $1,499. 99. "

As people say “History tends to repeat itself”, a somewhat similar thing has happened the Poco F2 pro is a rebranded Redmi K30 pro. What does the phone bring with it lets find out in this article? Key Specs:       Name   Specifications         Processor   Qualcomm Snapdragon 865       Rear Camera   Quad Cameras 64MP(Primary)+13MP(Ultra Wide)+5MP(Zoom Lens)+2MP(depth Sensor)       Front Camera   20MP(popup)       Display   6. 67 inches 60HZ AMOLED,180Hz touch sampling rate       Connectivity   5G, WIFI 6,Super Bluetooth       Battery   4700mAH(30W Fast charging)       Fingerprint   In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)       Charging   Type-C cable, with Fast charging   Design and Build Quality:The massive notch of the F1 is replaced by a fullscreen bezel-less experience on the front andhas an in-display fingerprint sensor on the front as well. The rear panel has a circular camera array and Poco branding, which is beautiful to look at. Both the front and back are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Display:This phone now comes with a glass sandwitch design put together by an aluminum frame, which is way superior compared to the polycarbonate build its predecessor(Poco F1) comes with. This phone comes with a 6. 67-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. We are disappointed to see a 60Hz display in 2020 but at least it comes with 180Hz touch sampling rate and a peak brightness close to 1200nits. This display also brings with it support for HDR 10+. We can also set different color types like Enhanced, Original, P3, sRGB.   Camera:The F2 Pro comes with a quad-camera array in the circular cutout on the rear. The primary sensor is the 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor, along with a 13MP (f/2. 4) ultra-wide-angle lens with 123-degree FOV, a 5MP telephoto macro camera and a 2MP depth sensor. The phone also supports 8k video capture. On the selfie side of things it comes with a 20MP pop-up camera with support for slow-motion video and other cool features. We think the pop-up cameras are not the one everyone liked.   Connectivity:This phone comes with the top of the line snapdragon 865 with support for WIFI 6,5G. This phone also supports super Bluetooth,NFC, GPS. It also comes with a 3. 5mm headphone jack at the top which is rear to see in flagships nowadays. Poco also includes an IR blaster to let you control home appliances. Hardware and Software:This phone is powered by top of the line Qualcomm’s snapdragon 865. This also has Liquid cooling 2. 0 to help the phone sustain high performance for longer periods and coming to software set if things, It runs MIUI 11 for Poco which is based on Android 10 out of the box. The feature offered by the Poco launcher is exactly similar to MIUI 11. The only difference is that this launcher offers a clutter-free app drawer. It will also get MIUI 14. Battery &amp; Charging:This phone comes with a huge 4,700 mAh battery and support for 30W fast charging, which promises to top up the entire phone in 63 minutes. We are not sure about the wireless charging as of now. Pricing:This phone comes in two configurations – 6GB+128GB and 8GB+256GB and has been priced starting at 499 euros (around Rs. 40,750). You will need to shell out 599 euros (around Rs. 48,900) forthe 8GB+256GB variant. Opinion:We think that the phone is overpriced for what it brings on board with it. We are really hoping for real poco series not the rebranded versions of redmi series. We really enjoyed poco F1 and we want the fire of POCO in it’s successors also. upto MIUI 14 "

    "body": "2020/05/12 - I’ve spent a good chunk of my workday so far creating AI-generated memes in seconds with just simple clicks. Usually I do make memes when I’m free but after knowing that I can generate memes using AI, I started testing the algorithm and results as pretty cool. Kudos to ImgFlip’s Ai based meme generator. Why this is interesting?At a glance, it looks like your random collection of meme templates. But those memes aren’t real, I mean not at all generated by humans. They are being created at that instance of time by an artificial intelligence (AI) ALgorithm that can understand meme creation technique and can generate some cool memes. You can directly ask for generating a meme with random template or else you can select a template out of 40 viral meme templates to generate a meme.  How it works?These captions are generated by a deep artificial neural network. Nothing about the text generation is hardcoded, except that the maximum text length is limited for sanity. The model uses character-level prediction, so you can specify prefix text of one or more characters to influence the text generated. Using someone’s name or other short text as a prefix works best. The network was trained using public images generated by users of the Imgflip Meme Generator for the top 48 most popular Meme Templates. Beware, no profanity filtering was done on the training data so you may encounter vulgarity. Basically, Imgflip’s neural network processed a lot of memes and then tried to predict what memes should look like. The results are often hilarious, and they certainly feel like real memes. Here are collection of some crazy memes generated there.      Try creating different memes and share with us on Twitter or Instagram.

    "body": "2020/05/08 - Snippet tools are incredibly useful. The idea is to save time that would have otherwise been wasted typing phrases, sentences or entire paragraphs. Espanso is an open source text template program for Windows, Mac and Linux that helps users save time. During the installation, you have the choice to add Espanso to “PATH” (Windows System Variable) and to enable it to auto-start with Windows. You will also need to restart the computer to get the program working. properly; I think it requires the restart to enable the “PATH” correctly. Start the program and you should see an icon on the system tray. Right-clicking on it allows you to disable it or exit the program. Espanso works in all applications including Notepad, Word, Firefox, Thunderbird, and more. Matches: Espanso uses the concept of Matches (keyword recognition) i. e. , when you type a word that’s present in the program’s settings, it triggers the application to substitute the keyword with its configured replacement. The official wiki explains the technical details rather well, but I’ll demonstrate how it works below for your convenience. Fire up a text editor or browser, or any other program that accepts text input. Type the word :espanso and it will magically be replaced with the phrase “Hi there!”. In this case “:espanso” is the keyword and “Hi There” is the replaced text.  If you haven’t guessed it already, Espanso is the Italian word for Expanded. IndicateTLS highlights TLS security protocol version in Firefox’s address bar Capture images and annotate them quickly with Draft NotesCapture images and annotate them quickly with Draft Notes So, how do we customize Espanso?Go to the application’s “Roaming” folder in your User directory. This folder contains a “default. yml” file. Open it using a text editor, e. g. Notepad works just fine. Espanso uses YAML syntax, which is very user-friendly. Look at the highlighted section in the screenshot below. That’s the match trigger and replacement which I mentioned in my example. Rules: The indentation is necessary for the syntax to work. So if your match isn’t being triggered correctly, check the spacing in the syntax. The other rule is to remember to use the : symbol. For e. g. :espanso vs espanso. The first one is correct, the latter won’t trigger the program. How to add new words to Espanso?: Let’s try adding a new one. Write a new trigger word and choose a replacement phrase. To make it easy, you can just copy the “espanso” trigger, paste it in a new line and edit it. Save the document, exit Espanso and start it again. Now type :ghx and it should be replaced with gHacks. net. That’s incredibly easy, isn’t it? You can use it to add email signatures, URLs, HTML Tags, commonly used phrases, responses, etc, and save some time.  You can even replace a text with an image, the syntax is slightly different. - trigger:  :word image_path:  /path/image. ext Replace word with the keyword you want and the /path/image. ext with the full path of the image’s location, followed by the name of the picture and its extension. This may not be practical in day-to-day usage, but the option is there, in case you want to use it. Closing Words:Espanso is fast, easy to use if you want to quickly insert words and phrases. "

    "body": "2020/04/30 - Xiaomi Announces MIUI 12, Here is a quick overview and list of phones which is expected to get this update. Xiaomi in its recent keynote along with its phone announcement, it also the latest version of its software skin MIUI 12. It’s a slight redesign of its exciting MIUI 11 and has quite a lot of visual changes. Let’s see what features does this new UI brings to the table. 1. UI changes:Xiaomi has been working hard to make their UI as refined and as minimal as possible. One of the UI changes comes in the notification shade, now we change some simple basic settings like wifi, Bluetooth in the notification shade itself with a tiny window and talking about looks, it looks much similar to control center found on the IOS.   The use of pictorial images to represent the status and data visualization ends up bringing a fresh look to the UI and the app animation(Opening and Closing) has also gotten much smoother.   2. Wallpapers:Wallpapers are one of the biggest visual changes and Xiaomi is calling them ‘Super Wallpapers’ and they look very cool, their live wallpapers which are based on high precision 3D models ofearth and mars and the fact that they turn into night scene when dark mode is added is a bounce. The live wallpapers feature for now is only exclusive to High-End Xiaomi phones.   3. Dark Mode 2. 0:You might ask me that we already have a system-wide dark theme in MIUI 11 so what’s new in this, There are a good number of improvements in it. This time the company has worked to improve the readability to reduce eye strain and the text is now brighter and sharper. Dark mode also brings a new feature called ‘Wallpaper Dimming’ feature that will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper(It also supports this feature for custom wallpapers. )  4. MI Health App:Mi Health debuts in this new version of MIUI. This enables, The phone can track users steps, sleep, workouts, and other exercises but the fact that to enable the phone to do sleep tracking the phone should be in the same pillow is a bummer.   5. Improved Gesture:This UI update also brings with it a slight improvement in the gestures. It now has a much lengthy bar at the bottom and much refined animations to go along with it.   6. Privacy enhancement:Xiaomi this time along has followed a three-pronged approach to improve privacy in MIUI 12, namely Flare, Barbed Wire, and the Mask System. Firstly, the flare will keep track of the app behavior of all apps on your phone and will present you the list of apps that may be violating the privacy policy or misusing permissionsand offer tips to avoid the above mishaps.   The second one is Barbed Wire, in which it offers several permission options similar to Android 10 and gives us options like for permanently allow or only when app is in use or allow only once and it even shows the icon of which app is using what services.   The third one is the Mask system which lets users to create and share virtual ID’s when apps ask about the data, we saw a similar implementation in the Color OS 7 skin as well.   7. Floating window:Android 10 itself has the floating window feature, MI included it to miui.   8. Ads:Talking about the Ad situation in MIUI only time has the answer.   9. AI :AI feature is only available to china at present. These are some of the important features coming to Xiaomi devices through MIUI 12 update.

    "body": "2020/04/25 - Ubuntu 20. 04 LTS has been released recently, after upgrading to it from ubuntu 18, 19, many had may faced booting problems(especially in DualBoot’s). Booting problems like bootloop(Restarting when ubuntu is selected) or blank screen after selecting ubuntu in the grub. With My experience, I am giving here few fixes you may try. 1. Uncheck the PPT security in BIOS Firstly goto the BIOS (It depends on the system, for Dell press F12), then goto security, then goto PTT security and Uncheck it. Security -&gt; PTT Security and uncheck PTT OnClick Apply (I would recommend choosing Save as Custom User Settings), then OK, then Exit. This should acctuallly work. If this does not work, try the second method. 2. Boot from Advanced Options While booting from grub, you can see “Advanced Options for Ubuntu”. Select it and in that boot from the Old Kernel. You may find many things like  Ubuntu, with Linux 5. 4-generic Ubuntu, with Linux 5. 4-generic (recovery mode) Ubuntu, with Linux 4. *-generic Ubuntu, with Linux 4. *-generic (recovery mode)Boot with Linux 4. *-generic, don’t boot with recovery or any other options availabe additionally. Now, you will boot into Ubuntu:). Remember, this method is not a permanent fix, you can use Ubuntu inthis way as long as you find the permanent fix, this will not do anything from accessing all the features. Additional Info: Why method 2 is not a permanent fix, because Ubuntu uses Linux kernel 5. 4, so grub will boot from it by default. After booting in you can change the default kernel to boot, but be carefull while handling with the Kernel. "

    "body": "2020/04/25 - Being core Python and Java developers we extensively use VS Code for our project development and use code formatting heavily to enable consistency of code while developing as a team and there are lot of useful extensions which will help you to ease your task and run things on your fingertips. Why Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas. Here are some Key Benefits of using VS Code -  Available on Mac, Linux, and Ofcourse Windows.  Edit, Build, and Debug very easily.  Highly configurable - Open-source project VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as NodeJS, JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.  Highly robust and Extensible.  High availability of industry and community-developed extensions.  Much loved dark themeInstalling Visual Studio CodeWe can download updated version of VS Code from their website - https://code. visualstudio. com/ Download from here - https://code. visualstudio. com/download Required Extensions for all developers: 1. Python extension by Microsoft - download  An extension with rich support for the Python language, including features such as linting, debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more! I personally use black code-formatter. we can configure it in our workspace settings in . vscode file. This helps to maintain code and code-formatting consistent in development.      Troubleshoot the code formatting plugin in python here   2. Java Extension by Mircosoft - download  Java Extension Pack is a collection of popular extensions that can help write, test and debug Java applications in Visual Studio Code. 3. Markdown Renderer Extension - download  Markdown Preview Enhanced is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities such as automatic scroll sync, math typesetting, mermaid, PlantUML, pandoc, PDF export, code chunk, presentation writer, etc. 4. Prettier Extension for JavaScript - download  It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. 5. ESLint - download  This will be useful to check JavaScript and TypeScript errors The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn’t provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven’t installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install. 6. CSS Peek - download  CSS Peek is a great tool if you keep forgetting what was a CSS class was used for. However, that could also mean that your CSS class names are not meaningful, or you have written too much “unmaintainable” code. Still, this is sure going to be handy if you are viewing/rewriting someone else’s code. 7. Debugger for Chrome - download  Debugger for Chrome is a great tool if you use a debugger in VSC. It allows you to launch an instance of Chrome navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Chrome. Using the URL parameter, you tell VSC which URL to either open or launch in Chrome. 8. Gitlens - download  GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more. 9. Git File History - download  This helps to quickly browse the history (edits and commits done by you and others) in a cool and interesting visualization.  you can try this in browser also. you just need to do these three steps.      Go to a file in GitHub (or GitLab, or Bitbucket)   Replace github. com with github. githistory. xyz   There’s no step three. you’ll love this.    10. Docker Extension - download  The Docker extension makes it easier to build apps that leverage Docker containers. The extension helps scaffold needed files, build Docker images, debug your app inside a container, and an explorer that makes it easy to take actions on containers and images such as start, stop, inspect, remove, and more. 11.

    "body": "2020/04/23 - Moto after 4 years has come back to making flagship phones with its new edge series, It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus. Let’s see what Motorola has to offer in this article. Moto Edge Plus:The standout feature of this phone has to be its design, It’s an all-glass display with metal frame holding them together, The edges wrap around the edges with a punch hole at the top and in one word it looks gorgeous with two color variants to offer namely midnight megneta and solar black. Before taking a deep dive lets see the specs. Processor:	Qualcomm Snapdragon 865Rear Camera	Triple Cameras 108MP(with OIS) + 16MP(Ultra Wide + Macro) + 8MP(3x Zoom with OIS)front Camera	25MPDisplay	    6. 7 inches 90HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio: 21:9) FHD5G support	both mm and sub-6 band. Battery	    5000mAH(18W)Fingerprint	In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)Water Resistant	Water Resistant(IP 68)Charging	Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 15W) + 5W(Reverse Wireless Charging)RAM/ROM     12GB/128or256GB Display and battery:The display is a 6. 7 inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the phone comes with a 90HZ refresh rate but the resolution is only FHD(1080p), which is a bummer at this price point but it helps increase the battery efficiency and in this phone moto has provided a huge 5000mAh battery and moto claims it can last till 2 days. Camera:This phone comes with a total of four cameras three at the back and one inside the punch hole. The primary sensor is a 108MP Samsung sensor which we saw in the galaxy s20 ultra, This camera by default shoots at 27MP and it has OIS built-in for stable video. The second sensory is an 8MP three times zoom sensor and this also has OIS for better video as well as zoom. The third is a 16MP Ultra wide sensor to capture ultra-wide shots. The selfie camera is a 25MP shooter. This phone has all the hardware required for a good camera it ultimately comes down tocamera software. Software and Hardware:Talking about software, It comes with an almost stock-like experience with a few added features based on android 10, and moto is calling it “My UX”. In days where flagship smartphones are removing the headphone jack moto has it in this phone which is a great thing. The hardware also is top end with snapdragon 865, It also supports fast charging, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging and all other high-end features to compete against the top of galaxies and iPhones. Pricing:This phone is priced at 999. 99 dollars which converts to around 75k price, which is very expensive considering what this phone has to offer. If moto really wants to bring this phone to India it has to reduce the price to somewhere around 55k. Moto Edge:Edge is very similar to Edge plus with very few changes. The main shooter is 64MP instead of 108MP, the battery capacity is 4500mAH instead of 5000mAH, It only offers 4GB/6GB of RAM and it does not support any kind of wireless and reverse wireless charging on it but the key difference is that it comes with snapdragon 765 5G on board. This phone is priced at 699 EURO, which is 58,000 rupees. I think this phone is fairly overpriced and at this price we can get several other optionsfrom vendors like one plus, Xiaomi, etc, which can offer us a flagship experience. Both these phones are expected to launch in India after the pandemic has ended,what do you think about these phones "

According to Kuo,this is because the 6. 7-inch model has the most complicated design. The above could mean that Apple will announce all the four iPhone models at oncebut the release dates likely going to be different for each model due to the production delays. iPhone SE Plus Delayed:iPhone SE 2020 has sold more models than Apple expected and there were strong rumorsregarding a plus model of the iPhone SE and was confirmed by the evidences found in the IOS 14 codehowever Kuo’s note says that the iPhone SE Plus is likely to be delayed until Q2 2021.

    "body": "2020/04/15 - One Plus is now 6 years in smartphone making. Its strategy was always to launch a phone that brought with it a flagship experience but not so expensive as a flagship but as years passed by its pricing kept on increasing from generation to generation. So, is this new One plus 8 a “flagship killer or a wallet killer”, lets find out in this article.  Lets talk specs for a while, it’s powered by the top of the line Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, which comes with a 6. 55 inches AMOLED with a 90HZ refresh rate, which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display. (For people who are unaware of display mate its like DXO Mark for Displays).  Coming to the camera its a triple camera setup the main sensory and the wide angle are the same found on the one plus 7t which are 48MP and 16MP respectively and the third sensor is replaced by a macro lens to capture closeup shots. The selfie shooter is a 16MP sensor which is the same one found on the one plus 7t. The battery capacity is 4300 mAh.    The phones pricing in India at this point of time is unknown but if we consider the price of this phone in US,We can expect a price at about 53,000 Rupees which is almost 13,000 price increase from the one plus 7t which was 37,999 rupees at launch.     The 13k price increase brings a new design change to the front which is punch hole display with curved edges(similar to the one found in the galaxy s10). The same old 90hZ display which is much brighter for better outdoor use.  The phones also comes with a slightly improved stereo speakers setup with dolby atmos support. The standout feature of this phone has to be the support for 5G and wifi 6. Conclusion: I think that one plus, for this time has ended up making a wallet killer. If what you really want 5G we have much cheaper options from namely the realme X50 and if you want the smooth experience of oxygen OS. The older one plus phones namely the 7t can give you the same experience for much lesser price. One plus 8 is meant for people whose first priority is design, oxygen OS and 5G in a single package. "

    "title": "One Plus 8 pro - The Real Flagship",
    "body": "2020/04/15 - It has been 6 years since one plus has been making smartphones until last year the company has produced a lot of flagship killer but the company from the past year has changed its strategy to produce a true flagship with its one plus 7 pro and 7t pro they were good but lacked the bells and whistles that a true flagship from samsung and apple had. With this phone one plus is trying to tick all the boxes of a flagship. Did it succeed, let’s see in the article below. Before taking a deep dive into the phones, let’s see what specs this phone has to offer:       Name   Specifications         Processor   Qualcomm Snapdragon 865       Rear Camera   Quad Cameras 48MP(f/178) + 48MP(Ultra Wide) + 8MP(3x Zoom) + 5MP(Color Sensor)       front Camera   16MP       Display   6. 78 inches 120HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio:19. 8:9)       Connectivity   5G, WIFI 6 Support       Battery   4510mAH(30T warp charging)       Fingerprint   In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)       Water Resistant   Water Resistant(IP 68)       Charging   Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 30W) + 3W(Reverse Wireless Charging)   If you have carefully observed the specs, this phone includes an IP Rating as well as wireless charging. This shows that one plus is not trying to cut corners against the best of samsung and apple but instead giving it all to take them head on.    The phone pricing in India is not out yet but if we consider the US pricing which is 899$ converting it into INR we can estimate the price to be at around 68k with this price it still manages to undercut the iphone 11 and galaxy s20.   Talking about the design, it has a single punch hole curved display similar to galaxy s10.  The highlight of this phone has to be its 120Hz AMOLED display which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display. (For people who are unaware of DisplayMate its like DXO Mark for Displays).  Coming to the camera its a quad camera setup and on paper can take on the other flagships nicely.  The Build quality with its glass body attached together by a metal has always been good but this time it also added dust and water resistance which is rated as IP 68(fit enough to withstand dust, dirt and sand and are resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1. 5m underwater for up to thirty minutes).  Taking about battery life, this phone comes with a 4510mAH capacity which is fairly good enough. The performance is also great coming with snapdragon 865 processor. This phone also supports 5G and WIFI 6 making it a future proof phone. The software thats the oxygen OS gives the cleanest andriod experience. Conclusion: One Plus ended up making a really appealing flagship smartphone undercutting the likes samsung and apple by a good margin and offering way more specifications at this price point. "

    "body": "2020/04/02 - Google is killing another one of its experimental apps — Neighbourly. The company said it’s shutting down the app on May 12, as the project didn’t take off as expected. The search giant first unveiled the app in May 2018 as a test in the Indian city of Mumbai to let you explore your neighborhood with help from local experts. Later in November, it expanded its base to a few more cities in the country. However, it failed to gain traction, likely because it simply didn’t have enough users to deliver an engaging experience. It never even came out of beta. In an email sent to customers, Google mentioned that the community answered over a million questions related to their localities, but the project didn’t grow the way the company had hoped: We launched Neighbourly as a Beta app to connect you with your neighbors and make sharing local information more human and helpful. As a community, you’ve come together to celebrate local festivals, shared crucial information during floods, and answered over a million questions.  But Neighbourly hasn’t grown as we had hoped. In these difficult times, we believe that we can help more people by focusing on other Google apps that are already serving millions of people everyday. Google also pointed towards Google Maps Local Guide to help people in your region find answers related to the area. The announcement comes at an interesting time: Facebook just rolled out a ‘community help’ feature for people to request or offer assistance in their neighborhoods during the coronavirus crisis. The app is closing down on May 12; you’ll be able to download your Neighbourly content until October 12. Another one for the Google Graveyard. Post Credit: The Next Web "

    "body": "2020/04/02 - Google had launched a new India specific Caronavirus site containing Health Information, Safety and precautions tips, Data &amp; Insighs and Resources to help. It also contains National helpline toll free numbers. The site also contains state wise caronavirus infected list. [update ends]😊✌ 21 March, 2020One week ago, President Donald Trump held a press conference wherein he claimed Google would be building a screening website for the coronavirus that would direct people to testing sites. As we learned in the following days, that wasn’t true. Google’s sister company Verily did launch such a site, but only for the Bay Area and reportedly it only offered tests to a very small number of people. Google, however, did say it would launch some sort of website and after a small delay, it’s here. Alongside the website and potentially more importantly, Google will start providing more enhanced information cards for people who search for terms related to the coronavirus. There will be information tabs for symptoms, prevention, global statics, and locally relevant information. It will look a bit like this: The website is at google. com/covid19. It does have useful resources, including a card that mimics what you see above. Google’s post announcing the site says that you will be able to find “state-based information, safety and prevention tips, search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators and businesses. ” Google emphasizes that it’s pulling information from “authoritative” sources like the WHO and the CDC. It’s only available in English right now, but a Google spokesperson tells The Verge that Spanish language support is soon to follow. The site was also designed with accessibility in mind, including with the larger fonts that Google usually uses. The website has videos in ASL, a global map showing confirmed cases by country, and plenty of information about Google’s other relief efforts — plus some feel-good YouTube videos. Reading through that description, however, you’ll notice that it doesn’t include what Trump originally claimed it would. The nearest thing to finding a test is a drop-down menu that provides links to local websites — for example, choosing California provides a link to the California Department of Public Health. Right now, the CDC has a “self-checker” chatbot that Microsoft helped build, but the WSJ quoted an executive from a healthcare provider who put in a realistic context: “It’s just something consumers need now to help with anxiety. ” In other words, lots of big tech companies are making efforts to provide coronavirus-related support, but none of them are able to solve some of the biggest problems in the pandemic: access to testing and the impending crisis in our healthcare infrastructure. At some point in the future, Google may actually provide a questionnaire and information about local drive-thru testing locations. But a spokesperson says that the company won’t do so until there’s authoritative and trustworthy information on those sites. That could be a long time coming, unfortunately. "

    "body": "2020/04/01 - Usually, to gain insight into what’s trending on the app stores, I either read prominent websites or look at the trending page on the app store. However, the problem arises when you have to look for global data. For instance, I am located in India and if I have to check what’s trending on the US Play Store, I would have to change my Google account location. Tedious! Recently, I stumbled upon a website that lets you check the trending apps in every country and even the app trend. It is quite helpful if you are an app developer and want to understand the trend of the market. It’s also helpful if you are a journalist who covers technology and currently trending apps. It helps you gauge the type of apps that are becoming popular within different countries and regions. How to find trending apps in any country?: Head over to this Similar Web tool and select the country. For instance, I have selected the United States as the country whose trending apps I want to see. Now, click on the “Go” button on the extreme right side. You will see the list of apps that are currently trending on the Google Play Store.  The website also lets you see trending apps on the Apple Play Store. In the first drop-down, you can select the store as “Apple App Store” and let other options as default. Click on the go button and it will populate the trending apps on the Apple store. Additionally, you will also see an “iPad/iPhone” toggle on just below the Go button.  There are a couple of different filters besides the App Store and the country. You can filter out apps based on categories like Fitness, Music, Productivity, etc. Moroever, you have a control to view popular paid apps as well. Additionally, the website shows you app trends as well. It’s a separate tab with multiple sections on it. One of the sections shows you apps that have become recently become popular and are new in the top 100 list. In addition to that, there’s a section that shows apps that have climbed their way and have increased their ranking in the top 100.  Another popular app research tool is AppBrain. In comparison, Similar Web doesn’t show you trends for an individual app, the number of downloads, etc. On the other hand, AppBrain is a furthermore intensive app data website. But, having said that if you write or develop apps, these 2 websites are a must-have bookmark on your browser. "

    "title": "4 steps you should take to secure your Gmail account",
    "body": "2020/03/31 - From bank statements to personal letters, and even password reset requests, your Gmail account holds an abundance of personal information. If someone were to access it, they’d effectively have access to the rest of your online identity. Instead of just hoping that hackers don’t find you, take 10 minutes and secure your Gmail account right now. Use a strong password: I suspect we’re all guilty of reusing simple passwords at some point – I admit that I used to. But reusing passwords across multiple sites and services is just asking for your accounts to be hacked. All it takes is a leak or breach at one service, and hackers will begin trying to sign in to all of your accounts. It’s time to step up your password game. Use unique, randomly generated passwords, for every online account you have. Keeping track of all those passwords is easy when you use a password manager. We have a roundup of the best password managers available, both free and paid, if you need help with deciding which one to use. To change your Google account password, visit the Google account security page and click on Password under the Signing in to Google section. Verify your password if prompted, then enter your new password – generated by your password manager – and click Change password. Enable two-step verification: Without two-step verification, also commonly called two-factor authentication, hackers only need your password to access your entire Google account – including YouTube, Gmail and Google Pay. And remember, if you reuse the same password for multiple services, they could get it from a data breach or through a phishing scam. With two-step verification, sometimes called two-factor authentication, hackers would need your password and a randomly generated six-digit passcode or physical access to your phone before they could gain access to your account. Turn on 2SV by visiting your Google account security page and clicking on 2-Step Verification.  Follow the prompts until you reach the section in the screenshot above. Once there, decide whether you want to receive push alerts in the Gmail app to approve login requests (the default option), or if you want to use random passcodes. Using alerts in the Gmail app is easier, but it means you have to have your phone nearby at all times. You’ll also need a connection to approve the alert. So, if you’re somewhere where you have no bars – like on a plane, for instance – you’ll need to be connected to Wi-Fi. If you choose to use a passcode, you can receive it via text message or access it in a password manager. I use a password manager to manage my 2SV codes so I can access the codes on any device, regardless of whether I have a data connection on my phone. If you opt to use alerts, click Try it now. You should receive an alert on the phone that was listed on the screen. Follow the rest of the prompts to complete setup. If you want to use passcodes, however, click on Choose another option and then Text message or voice call. Enter your phone number, and then enter the code to activate two-step verification. After entering the code and clicking a few more buttons, 2SV will be turned on.  But, wait, you’re not done yet. Though 2SV via texted passcodes is more secure than not using 2SV at all, I recommend using push alerts if possible. SIM-swap fraud is becoming more common, allowing hackers to take over your phone number and receive 2SV codes meant for you. If you must rely on passcodes, take a few extra minutes and set up an Authenticator app for your Google account. You can either use Google’s Authenticator app or a password manager. Click on Set Up under the Authenticator app section and then select the type of phone you use. Use your preferred app to scan the QR code, then enter the passcode generated by your app to verify everything is set up properly and you’re done.  Quick side note: There’s yet another, even more secure option for locking down your Google account that uses a physical security key which you can read more about here. For most people, however, carrying around an extra device isn’t a realistic option. At a minimum, you should turn on 2SV. Phew. That was a lot of work, but trust me, it’s worth it. Check your backup contact methods: Since the time that you first set up your Gmail account, you may have changed your phone number, or ditched an old email account. So it’s a good idea to double-check your backup contact methods. This is what Google will use should you get locked out of your account to verify you’re the account owner. Visit this page and look for the section titled Ways we can verify it’s you. Click on each section – Recovery phone, Recovery email and Security question – and update them with current information.  Again, if this information is out of date and you get locked out of your account, Google won’t be able to verify you own the account. Look at account activity: It’s possible that a hacker (or an ex) is accessing your account without your knowledge. To check, sign in to your Gmail account and scroll to the bottom of the page. You’ll see a line that says “Last account activity…” At the end of that line, click Details to see when, how and where your account is being used. If you suspect any unkosher activity, click on the button labeled Sign out of all other Gmail web sessions and immediately change your password. Now that you’ve secured your Gmail account, take a few more minutes to lock down your Amazon account. Then, do the same for your Facebook account and your Apple account while you’re at it. "

    "body": "2020/03/30 - Google chrome is one of the most used popular browsers. Firefox has improved a lot lately and is a better choice specially from the privacy point of view. However, if you are an ardent fan of Google Chrome, I won’t force you to ditch Chrome and move to Firefox. Ofcourse chrome is available for linux, but Google Chrome is not an open source and if you try to install Google Chrome from Ubuntu Software Center, you won’t find it there. It will probably suggest installing Chromium (the open source project Chrome is derived from). Chromium is similar to Chrome but it’s still not the real Google Chrome. . Now, we wil see the installation of google chrome. There are two methods to install Google Chrome.  Graphical install Command line install1. Graphical method [Begginer’s method]: If you are new to ubuntu and Linux world, this method is preferable(If you interested in administration, you can give a try with command line)Firstly go to the official website for downloading chrome. Download Google chrome You will see a download link there, now click the “Download chrome” button to download.  Now, you can see tat it is asking to select between two versions.  If you want to install chrome for other linux systems like Fedora, openSUSE download the “rpm package”, but we are now installing it for Ubuntu, download the ubuntu package. After downloading, open the downloaded file by double clicking it. Now,Ubuntu software center is opened and chrome will be staged for installation.  Now, just press “install”, google chrome will be installed. 2. Command line Method (Advanced or Interested user’s): This process is generally annoying for begginer users. So, follow the below steps carefully. To install chrome we need to download it. wget https://dl. google. com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64. debType the command in he terminal After the download process is finised, try to install it using the following command in the directory where you have downloaded sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64. debThat’s it, your system will be installed with chrome!!Coming to updating the chrome, you can update it while you are updatong your systems.

    "body": "2020/03/21 - Microsoft has started testing its Project xCloud game streaming service for Windows 10 PCs this week. The software giant is making the preview version, which lets you stream Xbox games to a PC, available to all Microsoft employees. The Verge has been able to obtain exclusive screenshots of how xCloud will work on PCs. Microsoft has developed an Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows 10 that will be available in the Windows Store. Much like the Android or iOS versions, the app requires a Bluetooth Xbox One controller, a Microsoft account, and a good internet connection. The PC app will also support streaming games from an Xbox One console locally or remotely, instead of using Microsoft’s xCloud server blades. There are a variety of games available to Microsoft employees to test, but the app is currently limited to 720p streams for now. “This internal preview is running at 720p resolution with 1080p just around the corner,” reveals an internal Microsoft support note. The experience is very similar to what is available on Android and iOS, even down to the user interface and the way you access and stream games. It certainly looks ready to be tested broadly, and it’s likely that Microsoft will roll this out to external Xbox testers soon. Microsoft also recently upgraded its xCloud server blades to include eight Xbox One S consoles in a single server instance. That’s up from the four the company was previously testing.  Microsoft is now working to eventually transition these xCloud servers to the Xbox Series X processor. This next-gen processor is far more powerful and capable of running four Xbox One S game sessions simultaneously on a single chip. It also includes a new built-in video encoder that is up to six times faster than the current external encoder that Microsoft uses on existing xCloud servers. Microsoft has committed to launching xCloud this year, with PS4 controller support and this Windows 10 streaming on the way. The Xbox maker is planning to integrate Project xCloud with Xbox Game Pass later this year, allowing players to stream games from the company’s subscription service directly from the cloud. *image and post credits to The Verge "

It has quite a lot going for it lets talk about it one by one, starting from 1. The design its the same one as the previous gen iPad Pro and you will not be able to identify the previous from the latest one by just seeing the front which is covered with bezelless screen with a screen to body ratio of just below 83%.  2. Talking about the screen its the same old IPS LCD panel, with 120hz refresh rate which is found in the previous generation of iPad Pro. We would like to have seen an Oled panel with the same 120hz refresh rate, but thats kind a nitpicking.  3. Good froward taught about the back side the iPad Pro has got 2 new sensors, an ultra wide sensor of 12MP and Lidar sensor to aid with depth sensing and ARKIT stuffattached in the same fashion like the iPhone 11.  4. Talking about the Processing power,the iPad Pro is powered by A12Z Bionic Chipset which according to apple is more powerful than windows PC. Going by the previous gen iPad Pro the claims might end up becoming true. .  Conclusion : Is the new iPad Pro worth paying attention to ? The simple answer would be Yes,The iPad Pro is trying to be the everything machine be it a tablet or an laptop. It already was a great tablet but talking about laptop apple is trying its best thats evident by the fact that it now Provides Proper cursor support(mouse) for the iPad Pro and it has a smart keyboard which has a trackpad below the keyboard now its all upto the iPad OS which decides whether the iPad Pro can really be a computer for all intensive purposes.

    "body": "2020/03/09 - Generally, many developers prefer to use either linux or mac. But, mac is a very costly thing where students cannot afford, but it is secured. Now coming to linux, we can’t just define it. It is very addictable using linux.  1. Performance:: If we talk about performance, Linux runs faster than windows, even with the improved graphics compared to previous it is faster. If we open android studio in windows whole system goes down, but in linux we can able to run some other programs parallelly. 2. Updates:: Windows updates are very irritating, they need need to reboot for every update and it takes a lot of time to update i. e reboot. But in linux the updates are very fast and very rare updates need reboot that too it takes very less time. 3. Flavours:: Windows only has one theme, and which is less customizable. Linux has many flavours and many of them are highly customizable. Some of them are Linux mint, Ubuntu, Kali Linux and many more. . 4. Security:: No system is safe, when comes to security, though Linux is more secure compared to Windows. There are various constraints for this.  Windows is widely is used OS, so it is a target.  Windows is preparatory software i. e source code is hidden, so bugs and flaws can only fixed by the company. But Linux is opensource so anyone can fix it. 5. Support:: Microsoft Windows support isn’t bad, but linux has more forums and chatroom’s and websites where support comes from enthusiastic, where as for windows we should relay on the Company forums where employees give answers much time.

    "title": "How to Rank on First Page of Google",
    "body": "2020/03/03 - As we all know, the biggest challenge in internet marketing is getting traffic to your website. However difficult it may be, it is a must if you want to be successful. You could pay for Google AdWords, and pray that your campaign doesn’t get slapped by Google, or you could spend a few extra minutes every day, and get a better listing with more traffic for free. So how did I get my listing on the first page of Google? I am going to show you in 5 simple steps. Ok, here it goes: Step 1Create a blog – 10 minutes unless you already have a blog or website. Setting up a blog is very easy. Go to Blogger, register for a free Blogger account, choose a name for your blog (being very careful to give a name that applies to what you will be writing articles about), write your first post to introduce the blog, and then move on to step 2. Step 2Write an article or press release – 10-30 minutes depending on the length. Be careful not to “sell” anything in your article. You should be giving advice, reviewing a product, or something of that nature. Make sure you place a link to your blog at the end of the article in the bio box. Step 3Create a Title for your article and make sure that it is a popular phrase – one that will be searched for. You can use the free keyword tools for this. You want to search for your phrase using quotes (“), and look at the results number at the top right of the search results — if the results are under 5000, and there are people paying for ads using that search term (look for the sponsored listings on the right hand side), then chances are you have found a winner. Use that for the name of your article. Always write your article and save it to your computer, as you will want to submit it to more than one article directory. Copy/paste your article in to 4 or 5 free article submission sites, and then copy and paste it to your blog using the same title as the “Blog Post Title”. If you prefer to just link from your blog to the article, you can do that as well, but the idea is not just posting to article directories, it is adding “important” content to your blog. Once you have completed this step, move on to step 4. Step 4Many of the article submission sites allow you to use the “Add This” feature, which allows you to submit your article link to Social Networking Sites. Many online marketers are realizing the importance of doing this, so I would not skip this step. Step 5Search for your title in 24 hours and find it on the first page of Google. Folks, it does not get any better than this. Imagine having 10-20 articles listed per month. Do you know how much traffic that would create? And to think that if you write good content, your articles could show up for months or years to come! The great thing about this is that even if you have never written an article in your life, once you write one, and it gets listed by Google, you will be hooked. And don’t forget, you are getting all of this accomplished absolutely free. Forget about all of the SEO, and maintaining a website. Choose your title wisely, and you will be successful. "

    "title": "Challenges Faced By Android App Developers",
    "body": "2020/03/02 - While developing mobile apps, businesses target Android due to its massive worldwide mobile operating system market share. Alphabet has made Android available as an open source mobile platform. Also, it updates the mobile operating system at regular intervals with new features and enhancements. But the penetration rate of individual versions of the mobile operating system differs. Alphabet does not regulate the Android smartphones, tablets, and phablets manufactured by various companies. Hence, the devices manufactured by different companies come with varying hardware features despite being powered by the same version of Android. That is why; it becomes essential for developers build mobile apps by targeting a wide range of devices powered by different versions of Android. While planning, developing, and testing the mobile app, they need to focus extensively on its accessibility, functionality, performance, usability, and security of the mobile app to keep the users engaged regardless of their choice of Android device. Also, they need to explore ways to make the app deliver personalized user experience across varying devices and operating system version. They further need to address a number of common challenges to develop a robust Android app. Understanding 7 Common Challenges Faced by Android App Developers1) Software FragmentationAs mentioned earlier, the market share of individual versions of Android differs. According to the latest data released by Google, the most recent version of its mobile operating system – Nougat – has a market share lower than its predecessors – Marshmallow, Lollipop and KitKat. Each new version of Android comes with several new features and enhancements. The developers have to include specific features in the app to make it deliver optimal user experience by taking advantage of these new features. At the same time, they also need to ensure that the app delivers rich and personalized user experience on devices powered by older versions of Android. The developers have to target multiple versions of Android to make the application popular and profitable in the short run. 2) Varying Hardware FeaturesUnlike other mobile operating systems, Android is open source. Alphabet allows device manufacturers to customize its operating system according to their specific needs. Also, it does not regulate the Android devices launched by various manufacturers. Hence, the devices come with varying hardware features despite being powered by the same version of Android. For instance, two devices powered by Android Nougat may differ from each other in the category of display screen size, resolution, camera and other hardware features. While developing an Android app, the developers need to ensure that it delivers personalized experience to each user by accessing all hardware features of his device. 3) No Uniform User Interface Designing Process or RulesGoogle has not released any common user interface (UI) designing process or rules for the mobile app developers. Hence, most developers build Android apps without following any standard UI development process or rules. When the developers create custom UI interfaces in their own way, the apps do not look or function consistently across different devices. The incompatibility and diversity of the UI affects the user experience delivered by the Android app directly. The smart developers opt for responsive layout to keep the UI consistent across many devices. Also, the developers have to test the UI of their mobile app comprehensively by combining both real devices and emulators. But often developers find it daunting to design a UI that make the app look consistent across various Android devices. 4) API IncompatibilityMost developers use third-party APIs to enhance the mobile app’s functionality and interoperability. But the quality of third-party APIs available for Android app developers differs. Some APIs are designed for a particular version of Android. Hence, these APIs do not work on devices powered by different versions of the mobile operating system. The developers have to explore ways to make a single API work on different versions of Android. But they often find it challenging to make the app work smoothly on different Android devices with the same set of APIs. 5) Security FlawsIts open source nature makes it easier for device manufacturers to customize Android according to their specific needs. But the openness and its massive market share made Android vulnerable to frequent security attacks. There are many instances when security of millions of Android devices has been impacted by security flaws or bugs like Stagefright, ‘Certifi-gate’ mRST, FakeID, Installer Hijacking and TowelRoot. The developers have to include robust security features in the application and use latest encryption mechanism to keep the user information secure despite targeted security attacks and security flaws in Android. 6) Android Search Engine VisibilityThe latest data posted on various website depict that Google Play Store has a much higher number of mobile apps than Apple App Store. Also, a large percentage of Android device users prefer free apps to paid apps. Hence, the developers have to promote their mobile apps aggressively to accomplish higher download numbers and implement app monetization options. They also need to implement a comprehensive digital marketing strategy to promote the app by targeting the most relevant users. Many developers have to avail the services of digital marketing professionals to promote their apps aggressively. 7) Patent IssuesThe users have option to choose from several Android apps offering identical features and functionalities. But developers often find it daunting to build apps with unique features and functionality. They often include features and functionalities in the app that make it similar to a number of apps available in the same category in the Play store. Unlike Apple, Google does not implement stringent guidelines to evaluate the quality of new apps being submitted to its app store. Lack of standardized quality assessment guidelines often make developers address issues related to patent. Some developers have to design and modify their apps in future to avoid patent issues. Most Android app developers nowadays work in agile development environment to build Android apps rapidly. They have to coordinate consistently with QA professionals, and participate actively in the mobile app testing process. Hence, the developers also need to address a number of common issues in Android app testing. "

    "title": "Some new Android 11 Features for developers",
    "body": "2020/02/28 - Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. 1. 5G experiences: 5G brings consistently faster speeds and lower latency to more users around the world. With 5G you can extend your Wi-Fi app experiences – such as streaming 4K video or loading higher-res game assets – to mobile users, or you can build new experiences designed specifically for 5G.  Dynamic meteredness API - with this API you can check whether the connection is unmetered, and if so, offer higher resolution or quality that may use more data. The API to include cellular networks, so that you can identify users whose carriers are offering truly unmetered data while connected to the carrier’s 5G network.  Bandwidth estimator API - API for 5G to make it easier to check the downstream/upstream bandwidth, without needing to poll the network or compute your own estimate. If the modem doesn’t provide support, we make a default estimation based on the current connection. 2. New screen types: Device makers like POCO, RealMe, Xiaomi, Nokia etc. . continuing to innovate by bringing exciting new form-factors and device screens to market. Extended support for these in the platform, with APIs to let you optimize your apps.  Pinhole and waterfall screens - Apps can manage pinhole screens and waterfall screens using the existing display cutout APIs. If you want, a new API lets your app use the entire waterfall screen including the edges, with insets to help you manage interaction near the edges. 3. Privacy:  Scoped storage - Google continued it’s work to better protect app and user data on external storage, and made further improvements to help developers migrate more easily. This preview release includes several enhancements, such as opt-in raw file path access for media, updated DocumentsUI, and batch edit operations in MediaStore. Along with these technical changes, based on your input, we are also giving you more time to make the migration and the changes will apply to your apps when they target Android 11. 4. Security:  Biometrics - It has expanded it’s biometrics support to meet the needs of a wider range of devices. BiometricPrompt now supports three authenticator types with different levels of granularity – strong, weak, and device credential. It also decoupled the BiometricPrompt flow from the app’s Activity lifecycle to make it easier to integrate with various app architectures, and to improve the transaction UI. All apps using biometric auth should move to the BiometricPrompt APIs, which are also available in AndroidX for compatibility with earlier versions of Android.  Platform hardening - It expanded use of compiler-based sanitizers in security-critical components, including BoundSan, IntSan, CFI, and Shadow-Call Stack. It is also enabling heap pointer tagging for apps targeting Android 11 or higher, to help apps catch memory issues in production. These hardening improvements may surface more repeatable/reproducible app crashes in your code. It has used HWAsan to find and fix many memory errors in the system, and it now offer HWAsan-enabled system images to help you find such issues in your apps.  Secure storage and sharing of data - Apps can now share data blobs easily and more safely with other apps through a BlobstoreManager. The Blob store is ideal for use-cases like sharing ML models among multiple apps for the same user.  Identity credentials - Android 11 adds platform support for secure storage and retrieval of verifiable identification documents, such as ISO 18013-5 compliant Mobile Driving Licenses. 5. App compatibility:  Easier testing and debugging - To help you test for compatibility, it had made many of the breaking changes toggleable - meaning that you can force-enable or disable the changes individually from Developer options or adb. With this change, there’s no longer a need to change targetSdkVersion or recompile your app for basic testing.  Check out the details here. There are also Updated greylists, Dynamic resource loader, New platform stability milestone in the new preview. There are some improvements in Connectivity like Call screening service improvements, Wi-Fi suggestion API enhancements, Passpoint enhancements and Image and camera improvements like HEIF animated drawables, Native image decoder, Muting during camera capture, Bokeh modes. source: Turning it up to 11: the first Developer Preview of Android 11 "

    "body": "2020/02/20 - Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. Google released the first developer preview for Android 11 and it’s a very earl stage and it comes with a fair features and changes. Let’s get started with 7 cool features on Android 11. . 1. Chat Bubbles: Chat bubbles first appeared back with Android Q beta versions, but it was not released with the stable version. But now it was released with the Android R’s first developer beta. Chat bubbles are similar to Facebook Messenger’s Chat Heads feature. It shows a bubble when you get a new message.  Generally, chat bubbles can be used by any messaging apps, but as of now only Google Messages and Gmail apps are using it. You can open a chat bubble for a conversation by simply long-pressing on a message notification and tapping on ‘Show in chat bubble’. 2. Insert images into notification replies: With this you can copy/paste, you can now insert assets directly into notification inline replies to enable richer communication as well as in the app itself. You’ll see image copy support in Chrome and image paste support via Gboard clipboard. 3. Improved Permissions: With Android 11, Google has made location permissions even more strict. In Android 11, whenever an app requests a permission related to location, microphone, or camera, the user-facing permissions dialog contains an option called Only this time, as shown in Figure. If you selects this option in the dialog, you have granted the app a temporary one-time permission.  4. Native Screen Recorder: Now you can access the built-in screen recorder functionality from the Quick Settings panel. Tapping on this starts a 3 second timer before the screen starts being recorded. There’s also a handy notification to stop, pause, or cancel the screen record.  5. Improved Do Not Disturb: Android 11 also brings improvements to Do Not Disturb — mostly in that it gives better support for managing DND exceptions. You can set do not disturb exceptions for particular callers, specific apps, or just allow alarms and reminders to ring regardless of the DND status on your phone. 6. Scheduled Dark Mode: In android 10 Dark mode has been introuduced, system-wide. Now, it has some improvements like Scheduling it like  You can turn it on at sunset and can turn at sun rise.  You can also turn it on or of at a specific time. 7. Pin Apps in the Share Menu: You can now pin your apps, that you share the most content with. Now these cannot bu replaced by just random apps that are installed in your device. Other Changes and Features:  Conversations : Dedicated conversations section in the notification shade - users can instantly find their ongoing conversations with people in their favorite apps. "

    "body": "2020/02/18 - Writing code for python telegram bot is easy. We add some extra things to integrate with telegram. Follow me you can build a bot easily. . Requirements for PythonTelegramBot :: Firstly, get your bot a token and a username. Search for “botfather” in telegram. Now follow the instructions in the BotFather. . This is the link for the official BotFather https://t. me/BotFather  Rember the username is unique, so if the username is taken, try another one.  Remember the API_TOKEN is confidential, secure it.  Else your bot can be controlled by others.    Now we need to install some libraries for getting startedpip3 install telebot pip3 install python-telegram-bot Our first program :: Here is the simple bot which echo’s what you sent to it.  #!/usr/bin/python # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.  # It echoes any incoming text messages.   import telebot       API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'       bot = telebot.

Just send anything and I'll send the same thing to you!\n )             # Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text']) @bot. message_handler(func=lambda message: True) def echo_message(message): bot. reply_to(message, message. text)           bot. polling()Now run the code by python3 file_name. py This is a simple echo bot. What ever the message you send to it, it sends you the same message.  Below are some predefined commands for our bot, so with out typing the whole sentence we can just type the command for the output.   @bot. message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])    Below this we should write the function that should be executed when the command is sent.  Till now we have written a simple program. Deploying PythonTelegramBot in Heroku: For deploying our bot we will use Flask, because for contacting bot we use webhooks method. So, to install flask use, pip3 install flask After installing we should change our code a little bit so as to work with flask.  server = Flask(__name__) PORT = int(os. environ. get('PORT', '8443'))Use the below code at the end of the application. @server. route('/' + API_TOKEN, methods=['POST']) def getMessage():   bot. process_new_updates([telebot. types. Update. de_json(request. stream. read(). decode( utf-8 ))])   return  ! , 200   @server. route( / ) def webhook():   bot. remove_webhook()   bot. set_webhook(url='Your_App_Name_Link_Here' + API_TOKEN)   return  ! , 200   if __name__ ==  __main__ : server. run(host= 0. 0. 0. 0 , port=int(os. environ. get('PORT', 5000)))After this the final code looks like  #!/usr/bin/python # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.  # It echoes any incoming text messages.   import telebot from flask import Flask, request import os API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'       bot = telebot.

So to get the librares use pip3 freeze requirements. txt You can see the libraries in “requirements. txt”. Don’t remove the libraries that you don’t know as they are dependent libraries. Now we should create a “Procfile” and type this code in that file web: python3 file_name. py Don’t change name of “requirements. txt” and “Procfile”(‘P’ is capital). Now, open github and create your repository, after that upload your file_name. py,requirements. txt and Procfile to github. Signup/Signin to heroku and Create a new app. Now, go to the Deploy section and now connect to github, then after type your repository name and connect it. Every thing is done. You are set to goNow press come down and press deploy branch. After successfull deployment you can use your bot. You can get your app name from settings section in heroku. "

    "body": "1999/05/17 - Writing extensions is not that difficult, if you had an implementation with you and if you know basic web technologies like html, css and js, it is quiet enough for building a basic extension. In this tutorial we will build a basic chrome extension that allows the user to change the background color of any page on DevsKrate. com. Before getting started, know the basic things. When you click on an extension, we get a popup, it is a html file. We need to design the html page and the script behind it.  Firstly create a directory with the name of your extension. Let us name our extension as “dev example”. Create the Manifest file: Every extension start from their manifest file, so create a manifest. json and include the following code. {  name :  dev example ,  version :  1. 0 ,  description :  First extension example! ,  manifest_version : 2}The manifest file is the blueprint for the Extension. It tells the browser engine what version of the Extension API the Extension expects, the name and description of the Extension, and lots of other details.  Now open chrome and enter chrome://extensions in the url bar to open chrome extensions page or it can be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.  Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.  Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory. Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic toolbar icon will be created for the extension. Add Instruction: Now the second step is to add the instructions(script) what our extension needs to do. Before that we need to include the background script in the manifest file. Remember Background scripts, and many other important components, must be registered in the manifest. Registering a background script in the manifest tells the extension which file to reference, and how that file should behave. Update the manifest file with the below code: {  name :  dev example ,  version :  1. 0 ,  description :  First extension example! ,  background : {   scripts : [ background. js ],   persistent : false },  manifest_version : 2}Now create background. js file and then include the below code. It sets the background color. chrome. runtime. onInstalled. addListener(function() {  chrome. storage. sync. set({color: '#3aa757'}, function() {   console. log( The color is green.  );  });}); This script uses storage API for storing the color values. Including storage API and other API’s we should give permission in the manifest file. So include the following code in the manifest. json.   { name :  dev example , version :  1. 0 , description :  First extension example! , permissions : [ storage ], background : {  scripts : [ background. js ],  persistent : false}, manifest_version : 2}   Introduce a User Interface: Extensions can have many forms of a user interface, but this one will use a popup. Create a file named popup. html in the extension directory. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;style&gt;    button {     height: 30px;     width: 30px;     outline: none;    }   &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;button id= changeColor &gt;&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Now same as the background. js script, we should mention the popup. html in the manifest under page_action, like   page_action : {   default_popup :  popup. html },    We should also include the icons for our extensions in the manifest. json file as   default_icon : {    16 :  images/get_started16. png ,    32 :  images/get_started32. png ,    48 :  images/get_started48. png ,    128 :  images/get_started128. png   }    Download the images here.   There is also need of images for permissions warning, and favicon. These images are designated in the manifest. json under icons   icons : {   16 :  images/get_started16. png ,   32 :  images/get_started32. png ,   48 :  images/get_started48. png ,   128 :  images/get_started128. png  },    Add declared rules to the background. js script with the declarativeContent API within the runtime. onInstalled listener event.   chrome. declarativeContent. onPageChanged. removeRules(undefined, function() {  chrome. declarativeContent. onPageChanged. addRules([{   conditions: [new chrome. declarativeContent. PageStateMatcher({    pageUrl: {hostEquals: 'developer. chrome. com'},   })   ],     actions: [new chrome. declarativeContent. ShowPageAction()]  }]); });    The extension will need permission to access the declarativeContent API in its manifest. json.   { name :  Getting Started Example ,. . .  permissions : [ declarativeContent ,  storage ],. . . }   The browser will now show a full-color page action icon in the browser toolbar when users navigate to a URL that contains DevsKrate. com. When the icon is full-color, users can click it to view popup. html.  The last step for the popup UI is adding color to the button. Create and add a file called popup. js with the following code to the extension directory.   let changeColor = document. getElementById('changeColor');chrome. storage. sync. get('color', function(data) { changeColor. style. backgroundColor = data. color; changeColor. setAttribute('value', data. color);});    This code grabs the button from popup. html and requests the color value from storage. It then applies the color as the background of the button. Include a script to popup. js in popup. html.    &lt;script src= popup. js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;   Layer Logic: The extension now knows the popup should be only available to website DevsKrate. com and displays a colored button when the website is opened, but needs logic for further user interaction. Update popup. js and include the following code  changeColor. onclick = function(element) {  let color = element. target. value;  chrome. tabs. query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {   chrome. tabs. executeScript(     tabs[0]. id,     {code: 'document. body. style. backgroundColor =  ' + color + ' ;'});  }); };The updated code adds an onclick event the button. This turns the background color of the page the same color as the button.  The manifest. json will need the activeTab permission to allow the extension temporary access to the tabs API. This enables the extension to call tabs. executeScript.    permissions : [ activeTab ,  declarativeContent ,  storage ]    The extension is now fully functional! Reload the extension, refresh this page, open the popup and click the button to turn it green! However, some users may want to change the background to a different color, so we need to provide options to the users.  Users Options: The extension currently only allows users to change the background to green. Including an options page gives users more control over the extension’s functionality, further customizing their browsing experience.  Create options. html and include the following code&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;style&gt;    button {     height: 30px;     width: 30px;     outline: none;     margin: 10px;    }   &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;div id= buttonDiv &gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Choose a different background color!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;script src= options. js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/html&gt;Then register this in the manifest. json page by adding this line, in the middle.  options_page :  options. html ,Now everything is fine, but if user goes the options. html page and selects the color, we need to change it, so we need a script for it. Create a options. js file in the directory. let page = document. getElementById('buttonDiv'); const kButtonColors = ['#3aa757', '#e8453c', '#f9bb2d', '#4688f1']; function constructOptions(kButtonColors) {  for (let item of kButtonColors) {   let button = document. createElement('button');   button. style. backgroundColor = item;   button. addEventListener('click', function() {    chrome. storage. sync. set({color: item}, function() {     console. log('color is ' + item);    })   });   page. appendChild(button);  } } constructOptions(kButtonColors);Just refresh the extension!!, kudos you have built a basic extension. Test by going to DevsKrate. com, it will work for all the pages of the Domain, check it out. It will not work for the article(posts) pages because we have a dark theme for our articles, so you need to give special permissions to overwrite it and give the background color. "

From hardware perspective, with the OnePlus 8 making a few minor improvements in areas like the display, battery, storage options, and of course, 5G support. The only perk is that OnePlus 8 is that, it is packed with a more energy efficient processor making its battery life a whole lot improved.  But the whole lot of caviar comes here as OnePlus 7T already has a decent full-day battery life and in a country like India where 5G is mere dream until the end of 2022. Also OnePlus 7T had a advantage of ultra wide camera for beautiful and wide angled photos. Final Verdict: For a massive ₹10,000 price difference sacrificing those little perks, it worth buying OnePlus 7T over OnePlus 8. Buy OnePlus 7T online at Amazon | OnePlus Store "

    "title": "6 photo-editing apps for mobile photographers",
    "body": "1993/06/24 - Your phone’s gallery is bursting with new pictures and photos you’ve taken over the years, desperate to see the light of day again and get a fresh new makeover. The iPhone app store on iOS and Google Play store on Android are full of creative apps that can give your existing shots a whole new look. And some of the photo editing apps, we’ve felt good are 1. Snapseed:Google-owned Snapseed offers a wide range of exposure and color tools to make tweaks to your images, but also has plenty of filter options, from vintage styles to modern, punchy HDR looks. You can layer the effects up to create some interesting edits on your image. And best of all, it’s totally free.       Available on iOS   Android (Free)   2. Lightroom:Adobe Lightroom remains an industry standard for professional photographers and the mobile version is much the same. You’ll find no stickers, animations or emoji here, but you will get fine grain control over your image and the same set of tools you’d find in Lightroom on desktop.       Available on iOS   Android (Free, In-app purchases available)   3. Adobe Photoshop Express:Photoshop Express has many of the same features you’d find in Lightroom, including exposure, contrast and color editing options, but strips out some of the pro tools and cloud syncing and, crucially, ditches the subscription fee. It’s a great tool for tweaking your images to bring out their best, but you’ll also find a decent selection of filters and overlay textures, as well as tools for making cool collages from your images.       Available on iOS   Android (Free)   4. VSCO:VSCO began life making color grading presets for Lightroom and its roots are clear in the app today. Rather than offer stickers and animated GIFs for Snapchat enthusiasts, VSCO is all about the more artful filmic color filters. The app has a huge range of presets available. It’s got a great selection of black-and-white filters too, making it a great choice to experiment with if you’re into your moody monochrome shots.       Available on iOS   Android (Free, In-app purchases available)   5. PicsArt:PicsArt has a huge range of editing tools available to you, from basic adjustments like exposure and contrast, through to cinematic color grading and dramatic filters that transform your images into painting-like pieces of art. There are loads of options for both the tone and shape of your face in selfies – I won’t go into the ethics of using these tools for “beauty” purposes.       Available on iOS   Android (Free, In-app purchases available)   6. Photofox:Photofox has powerful tools for removing subjects from background that let you composite in new backgrounds, or apply awesome effects. Photofox has endless possibilities of what you can do by layering and compositing different types of images and applying different effects to each. Available on iOS (Free, In-app purchases available) Hope these apps will be useful and will come up with new set of best apps in a different category✌.

    "title": "7 Things Android can do better than iOS",
    "body": "1993/06/20 - Google’s Android Operating System is now a very mature Operating System and had been up with 11 versions of different flavours. Google released the first public beta of Android 11 last week, and it does look good. From the new Quick Controls screen to a built-in screen recording tool, Android users are in for a treat when it launches later this year. Apple will have its first chance to show off what iOS 14 is going to bring iPhones at WWDC on June 22, but for now, it’s looking like Android 11 could expand the list of features that the iPhone doesn’t yet have. Right now, I want to highlight some of Android’s strengths that iOS just can’t do yet, from your being able to set default apps and use more than one app at a time to being able to completely customize the look of your phone. Use the apps you want, not the apps Google wants you to use: The option to set Gmail as the default email app on an iPhone is something iOS users have been asking Apple to add for years. Even though Apple added the option to delete its own apps from iOS, you still can’t set a default app. It’s tragic, really. Android, on the other hand, lets you set Firefox or Opera as your default browser instead of Google Chrome, or set Google’s Messages app as your text messaging app of choice to take advantage of RCS, Google’s recently released chat feature that acts a lot like Apple’s iMessage. To change the default apps in Android: Open the Settings app and go to Apps &amp; notifications &gt; Default apps. To change the defaults, select the app category, such as Phone app or Browser app, and choose from the options.  Google Assistant is always at an edge: iPhone users have Siri, but Android gives you Google Assistant. Google Assistant is a much more sophisticated tool than Apple’s Siri for a lot of reasons, but the most important one is that it makes use of Google’s impressive database. Google Assistant can understand common requests for businesses and names, and it gets requests right more often than wrong. It also returns high-quality responses, drawing from Google Search, a tool that Siri doesn’t have access to. Google Assistant is far ahead at features like voice recognition, ability to use different voices, and lot more.  Use two apps at once through split-screen mode: Even though iPadOS 13 supports using multiple apps at the same time, iOS 13 and the iPhone do not. Android users, however, have had split-screen apps since 2016 with the release of Android 7. 0 Nougat. Using two apps is helpful if you’re trying to look up a contact’s phone number to send to someone on Facebook Messenger, or if you need to reference information in a document when composing an email. It’s unclear why Apple hasn’t added this feature to the iPhone yet.  Customize your home screen, how you like it: Apple’s approach to the home screen is to place all installed apps in a rigid grid across multiple pages. Most Android devices take a two-pronged approach by giving you a home screen and an app drawer. The home screen doesn’t follow a grid layout, allowing you to place apps anywhere you’d like. Both platforms let you make folders containing groups of apps. The benefit of Android’s approach is that you can customize the home screen by arranging app icons in any pattern of your choosing, and Android supports widgets of varying sizes. Right now, Apple’s Today view is the only place you’ll find a widget.  Use launchers to fully customize your phone: Launchers are the epitome of Android customization. These apps let you completely change how you interact with the home screen, the app drawer and even the app icons on your phone. Using a launcher on your Android phone allows you to customize almost every aspect of how your phone looks and behaves, making your phone even more personal than it already is. Launchers like Nova Launcher, Microsoft’s Launcher, Apex Launcher and Action Launcher all add their own twists and features to your Android phone.  Never get bored with automatic wallpapers: The Wallpapers app refreshes the wallpaper on your home screen and lock screen daily, without you having to do a thing. There are several different categories of wallpaper styles to choose from. Pick your favorite, and let the app take care of the rest. Personally, I like to use the geometric shapes category. The wallpapers are unique and colorful which iOS can’t.  The magic of Picture in Picture mode: If you’ve started navigating in Google Maps lately, only to leave the app to answer a text message, you’ve probably seen a small Google Maps window remain visible in a corner of the screen. Android gained a systemwide picture-in-picture mode for more than just video apps with the release of Android Oreo in 2017. In addition to Google Maps and video apps, you can also use picture-in-picture for video calls with supported apps. iPhones don’t have any sort of picture-in-picture mode. What you see on the screen is what you get.  So, these are a few things Android can do better then iOS. Not that Apple’s iOS is an incapable operating system, iOS had also done some revolutionising things of appreciation. Soon see you with the features that iOS can do better than Android😊✌. "

    "title": "Install Chrome OS in a PC",
    "body": "1993/05/29 - There has been many people searching for the installation of Chrome OS on a old PC or a laptop. So, today we’re gonna guide you how to install full chrome OS with access to Android from within Chrome OS on an old laptop or an old PC and this isn’t using Chromium OS, Cloud OS or Fade OS this is Chrome OS that you can install on pretty much any Intel based PC. This is full chrome OS for your laptop or your desktop we also have access to Android and the Google Play Store and you can install Linux apps just like you can with most of the newer Chromebooks out there this is actually really easy to install and use. I’ll give you a quick rundown first thing you’re gonna need is a USB Drive 16 gigabytes or larger what we’re gonna do is install Linux Mint on this USB Drive so you can run it live we’re also gonna transfer our Chrome OS installation files to that USB. Basically what we’re gonna do is start up Linux Mint running live from the USB and then install Chrome OS we’ll wipe the internal drive of the PC we’re going to be installing this on so if you have Windows installed on your PC and you use it every day don’t go doing this but if you have an extra laptop or an old desktop laying around you could definitely try installing and use Chrome OS. I’m going to be using a separate Windows 10 PC to get my USB drive set up but you could always do this on Linux or Mac some of the applications we’re going to use will be different on those operating systems but if you’re ready to get Chrome OS installed on your laptop or PC let’s go ahead and get started all right so let’s go ahead and download everything we need we’re gonna get this image set up on a USB Drive. For all this process, we’re going to download five files. They’re:  Linux Mint Rufus Brunch Files Install. sh File Chrome OS FileThe first thing you’ll need is that USB Drive we do recommend at least the 16 gigabyte Drive Downloading Required Files:: 1. We need to do is download Linux Mint from here. and we’re just gonna use this as a live USB so we can install Chrome OS using this operating system we’re gonna run this all from the USB. Download the appropriate version ie. , either 32 bit or 64 bit.  2. Then download Rufus that allows us to flash that image to a USB Drive.  3. Now, download the latest version of Brunch from GitHub. As of now the latest version is 4. 19.  4. Now we actually need to get the Chrome OS image and from this link you’re gonna find Rammus in the page using Find in page(Ctrl+F) and download the latest recovery build and extract it. As of this post, it is 80, but it could be higher. This this the largest file you’re going to download and it’s going to be around 1. 2 GB.  5. The final thing we’ll need is the install. sh file. For this you need to go to this page and right click and save it as install. sh.  Getting ready with the bootable drive:: Now place all of the downloaded files on to a single directory or on to your desktop. All the files you’ll be having are Linux Mint, Rufus, Brunch, Chrome OS Image and install. sh. First thing we need to do is flash our drive with Linux man we’re gonna start up Rufus from within this application we need to make sure that we have our USB drive chosen just make sure it is the correct USB. We’re gonna navigate to where we have the Linux Mint image and finally we’ll click start this is gonna flash Linux Mint to that USB drive so we can boot it up live on our PC you get a couple warnings Yes and we want to write this in an ISO image mode click OK all the data on the USB Drive will be destroyed. We’re now done with flashing the Linux Mint to our USB Drive.  Now it’s time to get the other files we downloaded. Create a folder called Chrome OS and move the install. sh file that we’ve downloaded inside of this folder. Now extract both the files Brunch and Chrome OS image and move all the files from both of them into the Chrome OS folder you’ve created. Then move the Chrome OS folder into the USB Drive.  Now, finally your bootable drive is ready. Installation::    Firstly, go to your machine BIOS menu(ie. , by clicking either Esc, F2, F9, F10, or F12 while turning on the machine) and Disable Secure Boot and Boot Option to UEFI.   Then plug in your bootable USB and enter in to the boot menu and click on the USB Drive.  After that select the Linux Mint option to run it live from the USB Drive.  Once you have selected Linux Mint, you’ll be directed to the Desktop of Linux Mint.  Make sure you’re online while you’re using Linux Mint.    Then go to the Chrome OS folder we’ve created in the File Explorer.   Then right click and open terminal in Chrome OS directory.  Now, in terminal run the command sudo sh install. sh. In this step it will download some dependences, that’s why you need to be online.  Now we’re going to install the Chrome OS and make this a strictly Chromebook. To do so, type Yes.  It will take around 5-10 minutes depending on your internet connection.  Once the process is done, you can either type sudo reboot or go to the menu and select Restart and remove the USB Drive. Then your pc will be booted with Chrome OS and follow the instructions on the screen to setup the device.

    "body": "1990/06/22 - Apple is well known for bringing groundbreaking technology like The Macintosh, which brought a Graphical User Interface(GUI), The iPod, which changed the entire MP3 Player and the iPhone, which paved the path for the advanced technology we are enjoying in our current smartphones. After the original iPhone, Apple launched several other products, some were good while some were bad but none of them were revolutionary and Apple’s AR glasses plans to change that. Whats AR:: AR stands for Augmented Reality. AR is a technology whose goal is to augment or enhance one’s physical environment by adding digital elements. Apple Glass:: AR glasses is not a new technology, we have already have seen several companies like Google, Microsoft, Oculus and other companies have already been making them mainstream but none of them could them mainstream apart from the dedicated tech community because they either the product lacks good hardware or good user experience and the good ones are expensive and Apple is planning to change that. Hardware:: Speaking about the glasses, it will look exactly similar to a ordinary glass. These glasses are said to run from the iPhone similar to that of the original apple watch. Each lens will be coming with an 8K display to show the contents. This will have no cameras for privacy reasons and instead will use a LIDAR( Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging ) to detect the environment, it is similar to how bats use sound waves to see the surroundings. Lidar is also found in self-driving cars and even in apple’s own 2020’s iPad pro and the lidar sensor in iPad pro is good enough to make a detailed mesh of its surroundings. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple glasses will be an accessory to the iPhone, and all the computing, processing, networking, and positioning data will be off-loaded to the iPhone. Offloading data to the iPhone will allow the glasses to be slimmer and lighter. The glasses are also expected to synchronize with iPhone to display things like text, email, maps, and several other things. According to a patent, the system will also have the capability of identifying vision problems and automatically adjust the refraction of the display and lenses to help the user see, this eliminates the need to wear a dedicated precipitation lenses beneath the ar glasses. Software:: These glasses are expected to run on ROS( Reality Operating System ) based on IOS. Apple is also planning for a 3rd party apps and a dedicated app store. The user interface can be controlled by gestures on the frames or by using hands. Expectations:: The Apple approach of simplicity and attention to detail when it comes to user experience has helped make the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone the success they got and we are expecting the same strategy will help AR come to the mainstream. The product is expected to come in 2022 at a price point of 499$. Source: Internet. "

    "title": "One Plus 8 V/s Realme X50 Pro 5G V/s Vivo iQOO 3:The Best Flagship Killer?",
    "body": "1960/06/14 - The Flagship killer are the ones that have flagship specs with a lesser price tag to go with. Today’s contender’s for the best flagship killers are One Plus 8, Realme X50 Pro, and Vivo’s iQOO 3. We haven’t included the Poco F2 pro because it didn’t release in India yet. Let’s find out what suits you the best. 1. Design and Display:: Talking about the design, all of the three are glass sandwich design which is held together by an aluminum frame, but the iQOO 3 offers superior protection by offering the Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and back to protect it whereas the rest come with Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back. Speaking of thickness, the One plus phone is wave slimmer than the rest at 8mm. The X50 Pro is 8. 9mm thick and iQOO is 9. 2mm thick. One Plus is also lighter at 180g while the X50 pro and iQOO are a bit heavier at 205 grams and 214 grams respectively. Out of these three, one plus has a slightly bigger display measuring 6. 55 inches with the other two at 6. 44-inch, three of them offer AMOLED display at a 20:9 aspect ratio with HDR10+ support but the iQOO falls short at refresh rate, which is 60Hz while the rest offering a 90Hz. The OnePlus 8 and iQOO 3, both have a single punch-hole cutout on the front to house the selfie camera while the X50 Pro has dual punch-hole cutouts as it has two front-facing cameras, which include a regular and a wide-angle lens for group selfies. 2. Internals:: Powering the three phones is Qualcomm latest Snapdragon 865 which has ended up offering a smooth experience. Speaking of RAM and ROM, One Plus offers 8GB RAM and 128GB storage and a higher a 12GB RAM and 256GB storage. Realme offers a wider range of to choose starting from 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB and 12GB/256GB. iQOO offers a 4G LTE for the lower variants-128GB 6GB RAM, 128GB 8GB RAM, 128GB 12GB RAM, 256GB 8GB RAM, and a 5G variant with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage. The IQOO 3 offers UFS 3. 1 memory while the rest offer UFS 3. 0. 3. Battery And Charging:: Speaking of battery capacity, iQOO offers the biggest battery with 4400 mAh, while the Realme and One Plus offer 4200 mAh and 4300 mAh respectively but Realme leads in terms of charging speeds with its 65W dart charging, while the iQOO offers 55W Super Flash Charge 2. 0 and One Plus offers a 30W with its Warp Charge. 4. USER INTERFACE:: Speaking of UI, three of them are running on Android 10, but still end up offering a different experience and different set of features because of different skins they offer on top of android. One Plus offers OxygenOS, Realme offers Realme UI based on color OS and iQOO offers Monster UI based on FunTOuch OS. Our personal favorite is OxygenOS offered by OnePlus because it is closer to stock android with few to none bloatware. 5. Camera:: Speaking of cameras, One Plus features a triple rear camera setup the primary being the 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor with an f/1. 75 aperture and support for EIS and OIS. The second is the 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens with a 116-degree field of view. The last one is a 2MP macro lens for close shots. Turning to the front we find a 16MP selfie camera inside the punch-hole. Realme offers a quad rear camera setup with the primary being a 64MP sensor with f/1. 8 aperture, the second is a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, the third is an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 2MP monochrome sensor. Flipping the phone to the other side we find a dual-camera setup to the front one is a 32MP sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide camera. iQOO also offers a quad rear camera setup with the primary being a 48MP sensor, followed by 13MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, the next is a 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. There is a 16MP selfie camera on the front. 6. Extras:: Speaking about Biometrics, All of three offer in-display fingerprint reader and face-unlock Talking of speaker, Both one Plus and Realme offer stereo speakers, while the iQOO only has a single speaker. iQOO gains points for offers 3. 5mm jack, which the reaming doesn’t offer. All three have Wifi 5 and Bluetooth 5. 1 for connectivity. 7. Pricing:: Speaking of pricing, One Plus 8 is the most expensive one starting at ₹ 44,990 for the 8GB RAM, 128GB variant while the 12GB RAM, 256GB is priced at ₹ 49,500. Realme X50 pro pricing starts at ₹ 39,999 for 6GB RAM and 128GB, 8GB RAM and 128GB is priced at ₹ 41,999,12GB RAM and 256GB is priced at ₹ 47,999 and the iQOO for the non-5G variant, with 8 GB RAM and 128GB RAM is priced at ₹ 35,990, The higher 8 GB RAM and 256 GB is priced at ₹37,990 and the 5G variant which comes with 12 GB RAM and 256 GB starts at ₹ 44,990. 8. Verdict:: Speaking about the best phone, it entirely depends on the type of user you are if you want a smooth Android experience and regular android updates then One Plus 8 is the one for you. If you don’t bother much about the updates but want the rest of the important features like 5G, 90Hz refresh rate then Realme X50 pro is the best option you got. If you want the power of SnapDragon 865 but don’t care about 5G or the 90Hz Refresh rate then you can buy iQOO 3 at a much cheaper price. "
