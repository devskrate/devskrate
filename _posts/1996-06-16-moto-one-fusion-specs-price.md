Moto after being acquired by Lenovo has not been able to release a good mid-range smartphone but this phone might be the one to change this. Let's see what this phone has offer.

#### Design and Display:
Talking about the design, It's a plastic build phone with a notch-less design on the front. The screen is IPS LCD with a size 6.5 inch. It's an FHD screen with 1,080x2,340 resolution and a refresh rate of 60Hz. We would have loved to see either a higher refresh or an AMOLED screen. 

#### Internals and software:
Speaking of internals, it is powered by the Qualcomm-Snapdragon 730G which is coupled by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage and you can also expand the storage up to a 1TB using the Hybrid sim slot. It also comes with Bluetooth v5, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and Dual 4G VoLTE for connectivity.  Speaking of software, It's My UX running on top of Android 10, which is almost a stock Android-like experience with a few additional tweaks to enhance the user experience.

#### Camera:
This phone comes with a Quad-Rear camera setup, The primary camera being a 64 MP lens. The second sensor and the highlight of the phone is the  8MP wide-angle lens. The third is a 5MP Macro lens and the last one is a 2MP depth sensor. Speaking of selfie camera, we have a 16MP sensor.

#### Pricing and Verdict:
Moto decided to price the 6G RAM and 128GB ROM at 16,999, At this price, this is competing against the likes of Realme 6, Realme X2, Samsung M31, Vivo Z1x, Redmi Note 9 Pro and Pro Max. We think it's a good smartphone, if what you what is a stock android like experience and a full-screen notch-less display this might suit you the best.
