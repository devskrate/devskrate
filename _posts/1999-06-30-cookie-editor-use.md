Many of us want to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar freely and some of you want to read the articles in medium and other websites freely without logging in with your mail. Yes here you got a solution..

Generally cookies are used to store your information at your browser. Here are the cookie extensions that most people use and we recommend.

Google - [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en)

Firefox - [Cookie-Editor](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/?src=search)

#### Streaming
So, If you login in to netflix your username and password are stores as cookies, so you can search online for getting the cookies of the streaming sites like netflix, hotstar and prime. 

So, after getting the cookies insert them using some cookie editors extensions in google chrome and firefox.

Here is how you insert them..

**1.** Open the site you want to login with cookies and then press the cookie editor extension on the bar and then delete all the cookies..

**2.** Now press import button to edit the cookie..

**3.** Now enter the cookie you got in the net and then again press import button to insert it.

<img style="display: inline; margin: 0 5px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/browser/cookies/cookie-insert.png" width="500">

**4.** Finally reload the page to see the changes..

#### Reading or passing login freely

Generally sites like qoura and medium stores the cookies and then set a limit for accessing their site freely without login, like you can read quora stories only once, if you want to read more you need to login as shown below.

<img style="display: inline; margin: 0 5px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/browser/cookies/cookie-delete-for-read.png">

For these type of restrictions you can actually clear the cookies as described in the streaming sites method and can reload the page to access it freely.
