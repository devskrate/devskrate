We have seen Qualcomm forcing manufactures to include 5G with the latest flagship  Snapdragon 865, by not selling a separate version a separate 865 without 5G. We have also seen the company include its 5G modem(X51 modem) to the 700 series chips with SnapDragon 765 5G and now Qualcomm has decided to add the 5G modem to 600 series of chipset with the introduction of SnapDragon 690 processor.

This new Snapdragon 690, will be a successor to Snapdragon 675. It will offer 20 percent better CPU performance and 60 percent faster graphics rendering compared to the Snapdragon 675. It will also have support for high-end features like support 120Hz displays for faster refresh rates, 4K HDR video capture, 192-megapixel cameras.

Here are the complete specs released by snapdragon -

The 5G modem in this will only support slower sub-6GHz versions of 5G, not the faster mmWave standard. This 5G modem in this chipset will allow for a wider adoption of this technology. We can see 5G enabled smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 690 in the year 2021 at a price point of 10,000 to 20,000 rupees.
