#### Bigger Display and More Watch Faces:
Mi band 5 features a **1.1-inch color AMOLED touch display**, which is 20 percent bigger when compared to that of the 0.95-inch found on band 4, which we consider to be a minor upgrade but would like to have seen smaller bezels. Along with bigger display comes new faces 100 to be precise and these wallpaper will also have some renowned animated series, including Hatsune Miku, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and SpongeBob SquarePants.These can be found on the Mi Fit app.

#### More Sport Tracking:
This new Mi Band 5 has also increased the number of sport activities that the Mi band could record. Xiaomi has added **six new sport** activities to the already existing five-treadmill, exercise, outdoor running, cycling, walking, pool swimming. The six new modes-indoor running, indoor 
cycling, elliptical machine, skipping rope, yoga, and rowing machine.

#### Improved health Tracking:
This fitness tracker is equipped with a **PPG heart rate sensor**, which we found in the Realme SmartWatch, and with this Xiaomi claims a 50 percent more accurate than its predecessor. It also comes with stress monitoring and breathing exercises built into the band. It comes with improved sleep tracking. The band also has a dedicated women health Tracking which will help them track their period cycles, ovulation period, and more.

#### New Charging Method:
If you have used any of the old Mi band then you will know how hard is it to charge the Mi Band, Xiaomi solves this bring a new magnetic charger that charges which sticks to the Mi Band and charge it up with the help of contact pins.
The Mi Band 5 now comes with a smaller 125mAH battery than the 135mAH battery of its predecessor but Xiaomi still claims the same 20-day battery life even with a bigger display and a smaller battery, how true is it? It can be only told once the watch comes in India.

#### Verdict:
Mi Band 5 has **three minor changes**-Bigger Display, More Sport Tracking, Improved health Tracking, and **one major update** in terms of charging. We think the upgrade is not a major but still a notable one. If anyone who already owns a Mi Band 4 you need not consider the 5, but if you are planning to buy a fitness tracker, then you probably can wait for the band 5. Several leaks claim that the Band 5 will be launching next month.
