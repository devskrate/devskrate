Some leaks say that Apple is planning two major name changes to their products.
<br>

+ ios    -> iPhone OS
+ iPhone -> Apple Phone

This leaked from 2 well known personalities and trusted sources in Twitter  @jon_prosser and @MaxWinebach.
According to them their might be the renaming of their products.

By seeing this, we may also assume apple might enter to mid-range devices.

See, assume ios is gone and became iPhone OS, but iPhone gone and Apple Phone came, but iPhone is there in the OS not as phone.

So, we may assume soon apple is going to launch a mid ranger or may be a budget phone(no Possibly ;).
