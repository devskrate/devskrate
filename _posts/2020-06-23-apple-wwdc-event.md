WWDC: A Refiniment for all software platforms:

Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off today and released newer versions to it's existing software and also introduced several feature. These new feature were aimed towards making the existing software more refined. The softwares which were upgraded are
1. iOS
2. iPadOS
3. watchOS
4. tvOS
5. macOS

#### iOS 14:
The new operating system brings a redesign to the home screen which hasn't changed much since the first iPhone and much-needed features to catch up with what Android has to offer.
+ App Library:
This feature allows us to access and organize our apps much easier by creating a new space called the App library at the end of the home screen pages. It creates folders based on the type of apps and even has a separate folder for frequently used apps. It even has the option to hide pages, which you don't use.
+ Improved Widgets:
Anything we miss when we switch from Android to iOS is a lack of widgets on the home screen. This feature now lets you do just that, not only that you can even resize your widgets according to your wish. This even has a widget gallery, which contains all the available widgets available for a particular app. There’s also a new “Smart Stack” widget that automatically shows relevant apps based on the time of day.
+ Picture - In- Picture Mode for Videos:
Apple finally added system-wide picture-in-picture mode to iOS 14, which basically lets you hover over apps and adjust in size and you can even collapse into the side of the display to continue playing in the background.
+ Siri:
The most annoying thing when you call for Siri is that it takes up the whole screen and Apple addresses this problem with the introduction of a new compact design, there’s just a small animated Siri icon at the bottom. Siri can now take answers from the website. Siri can now help send audio messages in addition to just dictated messages.
+ Translate App:
Apple also introduced a new Translate app that will come built-in with iOS 14. It will allow users to easily translate between languages. Users will be able to enter text in or dictate messages and have them translated into 11 languages. English, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian will all be supported at launch and the fact that it is available offline makes it even more useful.
+ Messages:
Messages are also getting new features in iOS 14, now you will be able to pin important conversations to the top of the Message app to easily talk to your favorite friends or group chats. There is also 20 new hairstyle and even mask option and even ages options for memojis and there is also an option for groups inline replies, which helps to keep track of the conversations happening in the groups.
+ Apple Maps:
Apple Maps is getting new, curated guides from companies like Zagat or AllTrails to give better recommendations for new places. Maps is also giving a new option for cycling, with dedicated directions for bike-riding. Cycling will launch in NYC, LA, San Fransisco’s Bay Area, Shanghai, and Beijing. There is also a new EV Routing feature, which will track the current charge of your car and route you to compatible stations.
+ CarPlay and Carkeys:
CarPlay is getting support for custom wallpapers and new app categories: parking apps, EV chargers, and fast food takeout apps.CarKeys will let you leave your keys at home and use your iPhone as a key to lock/unlock your car. You can even share the hey using messages app and you can even apply a restricted driving profile. This feature will not only be an iOS 14 exclusive but will be supported iniOS 13 as well. The 2021 BMW 5 Series will be the first car to come with support for car keys. 
+ AppClips:
AppClips will let users access a small part of the app that you need without downloading the app. The new feature is meant to help users have quick access to the app. When you scan a QR code, a dedicated App Clip code or NFC tags, your iPhone will launch the App Clip card. You can tap Open to launch the app without downloading it. App Clips are compatible with Apple Pay and Sign in with Apple. This means you don't have to make an account with an app or use your credit card information. Users will be able to pay for takeout, parking, and learn more about local businesses just by scanning.
iOS 14 will be out this fall, but a developer preview will be available to Apple Developer Program members starting today, with plans for a public beta for all iOS users in July. iOS 14 will work on the iPhone 6S and up — the same devices that supported iOS 13.

#### iPad OS:

iPadOS 14, the latest version of iPadOS brings everything that iOS 14 packs, with some major redesign to how the interface looks on iPad's large screens. Siri is also getting a makeover on the iPadOS, it's now a lesser space with only a small icon on the bottom right corner, much like the iOS. The ipadOS also borrows features like universal search from macOS, which also you to not only on your home screens but also on any app. The ipadOS also brought several features to productivity apps like photos, calendars and redesigned them to make use of the much bigger screen real-estate available.
With this ipadOS update, Apple focused on making the already useful Apple Pencil much more useful. Apple Pencil now gets Scribble mode, which turns your scribbling into proper texts. This text can be copied and pasted anywhere. You can use scribble mode in the search menu as well. The iPadOS is getting a compact screen window for calls.The developer beta of iPadOS 14 is available today while the stable versions will launch this fall.

#### Watch OS:

Apple, with watchOS 7 brings the most requested features that's Sleep tracking, this feature will let you set a bedtime and wake-up alarm and will even help you in maintaining a proper sleep cycle. watchOS 7 will have a new feature called complications, which is Apple fancy term for widgets in Apple watch.  Now, developers will be able to enable richer complication combinations — more than one per app on a single watch face for the first time — so users can customize more detailed watch faces themselves. Face Sharing, which lets you share watch face with others. These will be available as curated watch faces in the Apple Watch app store or shareable between individuals or as links on social media sites.
The new watchOS now supports cycling directions and fitness tracking for dance workouts and Apple is rebranding the existing Activity into Fitness app. In the time of current pandemic washing hands have become much more important and to help users do it correctly this watchOS comes with a hand-washing detection system, which sets a countdown to tell you how long to keep washing to match the amount of time recommended by health officials.
The update will release this fall for the Apple Watch Series 3 and later, meaning Apple is dropping support for the Series 1 and Series 2. You’ll need at least an iPhone 6S or later running iOS 14 to support watchOS 7.

This also has support for Xbox Elite 2 and Xbox Adaptive controllers. Apple also brought audio sharing features and Picture in Picture Mode to the Apple TV.Apple tv can also play 4k video from iPhone or the iPad using AirPlay.

#### macOS:

Apple named its latest macOS as Big Sur. The biggest change is the new look. This is what Apple considers the biggest redesign after the introduction of macOS 10. Like the ipadOS, macOS takes much of its queues from iOS, including a control center for customizing brightness, Do Not Disturb, and several other settings. It also adds a new notification center, which keeps all of your notifications and widgets. It also brings pinned messages and several other message feature to the mac's message app. Apple maps also have the same feature changes to that of iOS 14.
Big Sur also features improvements to its core applications. Safari now features a new start page with customizable background images and sections like Reading List and iCloud Tabs. It also adds Safari can now also detect when you're on a page with non-native language and offer to translate it for you similar to google translate on chrome. The tab UI has also been changed with increased size and preview for tabs and the ability to close all the tabs which are right of the selected tab. Apple also claims Safari to the faster browser. Apple has also improved extension support, which allows developers to bring in their extensions from other browsers, which can be found on the Mac App Store but they can only access your data once you allow them. Safari also shows which trackers are being blocked by the browser.
Apple also announced the Mac platform will now be transferred to ARM and apple will be making its own A-series custom chipsets and Apple promises to bring its first ARM-powered machine by the end of the year and the transition from Intel to ARM will take two years.
